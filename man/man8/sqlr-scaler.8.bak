.TH sqlr-scaler 8 "11 17, 2001" "fire up new connections on demand"

.SH NAME
sqlr-scaler \- fire up new connections on demand

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqlr-scaler
[\fB\-id\fP \fIID\fP]
[\fB\-config\fP \fICONFIGFILE\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
You can start as many
.B sqlr-connection
daemons as you like. If you start fewer than the maximum number
defined for the \fIID\fP, the \fBsqlr-scaler\fP daemon will fire up new
connections on demand. The new connections will time out after a
period of inactivity and shut down on their own.

.SH OPTIONS
\fICONFIGFILE\fP is the filename of the configuration file to use. The
default configuration file is \fI/etc/sqlrelay.conf\fP.

\fIID\fP is the same as the \fIID\fP argument in the \fBsqlr-connection\fP
daemon and associates a scaler with a pool of connections.

Only one scaler needs to be established for a given \fIID\fP.

.SH SEE ALSO
