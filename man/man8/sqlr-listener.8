.TH sqlr-listener 8 "11 17, 2001" "connect to a TCP port and wait for queries"

.SH NAME
sqlr-listener \- connect to a TCP port and wait for queries

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqlr-listener
[\fB\-id\fP \fIID\fP]
[\fB\-config\fP \fICONFIGFILE\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The job of the 
.B sqlr-listener
is to connect to a TCP port and wait for queries. When it gets one,
it waits for an available connection daemon, hands off the query to
it, waits for the result set, and hands the result set back to the
client.

.SH OPTIONS
\fICONFIGFILE\fP is the filename of the configuration file to use. The
default configuration file is \fI/etc/sqlrelay/sqlrelay.conf\fP.

\fIID\fP is the same as the \fIID\fP argument in the
\fBsqlr-connection\fP daemon and associates a listener with a pool of
connections.

Only one listener needs to be established for a given \fIID\fP.
