GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991 

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software. 

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of
having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 

       a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

       b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
       thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

       c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
       use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
       warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
       user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
       announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. 

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 

       a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
       1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

       b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
       physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under
       the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

       c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
       only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
       with Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code. 

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance. 

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system
and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License. 

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation. 

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask
for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. 

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other
libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. 

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to
the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights. 

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the library. 

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the
library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software
will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.
This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. 

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to
a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. 

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because
most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. 

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries
themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving
your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as
regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead
to faster development of free libraries. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based
on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the
library. 

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
"you". 

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
some of those functions and data) to form executables. 

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".) 

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the library. 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a
program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that
uses the Library does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 

       a) The modified work must itself be a software library. 

       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

       d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
       other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
       application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
       meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if
       the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. 

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to
this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. 

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
copies and derivative works made from that copy. 

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. 

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code. 

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of
this License. 

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms
for distribution of such executables. 

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the
Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. 

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any
executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for
the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. 

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice
for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: 

       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes
       were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the
       Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
       modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who
       changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
       definitions.) 

       b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
       above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. 

       c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place. 

       d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. 

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable. 

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of
the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: 

       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
       must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. 

       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
       the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance. 

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system
and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License. 

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation. 

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

The "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License"

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
    "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
    "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
    to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

    For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
        Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
        Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
    If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

The "Artistic License"

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains
some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and
distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. 

Definitions

       "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
       created through textual modification. 

       "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
       wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below. 

       "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. 

       "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 

       "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people
       involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community
       at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 

       "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the
       item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 

    1.You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction,
       provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 

    2.You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.
       A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 

    3.You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
       stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 

           a.place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
              modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
              uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. 
           b.use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. 
           c.rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be
              provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs
              from the Standard Version. 
           d.make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

    4.You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the
       following: 

           a.distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
              equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. 
           b.accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications. 
           c.give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or
              equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. 
           d.make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

    5.You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of
       this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with
       other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
       advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by
       linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is
       so embedded. 

    6.The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically
       fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be
       aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or
       "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a
       distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such
       an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package. 

    7.C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
       emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are
       the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it
       to fail the regression tests for the language. 

    8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is
       embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial
       distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. 

    9.The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific
       prior written permission. 

   10.THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING,
       WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE. 

                                                      The End
