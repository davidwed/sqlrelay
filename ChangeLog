	made sure to delete each authstring before deleting the array itself
		in the listener
	major protocol changes, should be much faster and use much less
		memory

		correctly too

0.13 -	build fix: calls to "test" are now more compatible with non-bash
		shells

0.12 -	if connection receives an end of session, it sends a commit to
		the database, or more precisely calls the commit() method
		of the connection class which, for transactional databases,
		sends a commit and for non-transactional databases, does
		nothing.
	build now succeeds with gnome-xml
	added support for SQLite and Lago databases
	build now detects a suitable cpp command and uses it when building

0.11 -	perldoc documentation for the perl API
	added warnings to indicate when default parameters are fallen back on
	cleaner build
	added extern "C"'s around c includes - fixed dynamic loading bugs
	added varargs functions to perl API

0.10 -	put LDFLAGS into Makefiles
	configure now adds -static to LDFLAGS to generate static binaries if
		possible (not possible when linking sqlr-connection-oracle on 
		linux) Ran into problems when dynamically linking a binary on 
		one OS release then trying to run it against the slightly 
		different libraries of another release.  Stripped, static 
		binaries run faster and use less memory than dynamically linked
		ones anyway.  The only price you pay is space on the 
		filesystem.  If you'd like dynamic linking though and think 
		that it will work for you, just remove -static from the 
		config.mk.in file before running configure or the config.mk 
		file after running configure.
