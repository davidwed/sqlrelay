forked listeners need to close handoff file descriptors
handoff=pass does not work with dynamic scaling

docs and tests for clob/blob/cursor bind methods and upper/lower/mixed column
	case methods for non c++/perl api's

incorporate postgresql column type query
If a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up.
maximum allowed clob bind value length should be configurable
many of methods should be const methods
solaris init script
odbc connection should check the odbc definition
	for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
java/com/firstworks/sqlrelay needs to be removed if empty when rpm is
	uninstalled
java api needs clob/lob/cursor methods
java can't find sqlr_alloc
should sqlr-start kill the listner if no connections start?
float/double datatypes come back with no particular scale/precision in many db's

incorporate pkg-config stuff
incorporate ADODB driver
incorporate new spec file

test changeUser() with non-oracle databases
non-c++/perl clob/blob/cursor bind tests
clob insert/update/select tests
clob pl/sql in/out variable test
clob pl/sql return value test

interbase directions for using gsec don't work for me
interbase docs aren't available at the link in gettingstarted/interbase.html
db2 startup directions are wrong, you have to run db2start/db2stop as db2as
sybase startup can fail because LANG is set funny - need note in docs
fix documents to reflect java package

Tests:
	odbc tests
	better perldbi/pythondb/rubydbi tests
	test init scripts
	test send query w/length
	test upper/lower/mixed column case methods
	need database reconnect tests

Compatibility:
	sybase 12.5
	interbase 6.5
	firebird
	gtk-2
	ruby module segfaults on netbsd/openbsd
	python api methods that call PyArg_ParseTuple with an "O" argument 
		don't work on openbsd/netbsd, not exactly sure why

Documentation:
	getting started docs for MS SQL Server
	diagrams
	example sqlrelay.conf's for different configurations
	recommended settings for each db, scaling
	performance benchmark charts
	HOWTO for linuxdoc.org
	man pages

Performance:
	persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it, make it available
			to other sessions
	client-side persistence/socket handoff daemon
	connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	configurable preallocated buffers on the server side
	result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	server side result set caching
	support batch DML in oracle8
	for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client - is this a good idea?

Security:
	address connection hijacking for handoff=reconnect
	SSL encryption

Packages:
	Debian
	Slackware
	FreeBSD
	NetBSD
	OpenBSD
	Solaris
	OpenServer
	Unixware/OpenUnix

Features:
	sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained mode 
		and isolation mode when client connects
	sqlr-import/sqlr-export tools
	support output bind vars and stored procedures in sybase
	support vector binds
	handle output binds in Perl-DBD, Python-DB, Ruby-DBD
	changeAuth() for non-oracle8i needs to just log out/back in
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes
		handle blobs in interbase
		handle timestamps
	replication
	query filtering
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	a query should re-execute when the database comes back up
	master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to the fallback
		if the master is overloaded or down
		statistics, stat monitoring interface

openldap backend

API's:
	wrapper:
		PHP - ADODB?
		JDBC
		ODBC
		QT3
		TCL
		C# (mono?)
		ADA
	replacement libs for native db api libs - 
		translate msql/mysql/postgresql calls to sqlrelay calls

Native DB Support:
	Informix
	SAP DB
	LocalSQL
	kekedb
	ThinkSQL
	picosql

Config Tools:
	QT
	curses
	need keyboard shortcuts
	size should be less than 640x480
	connectstring editor
