probably related to temp table dropping:
	postgresql test causes connection to crash on 2nd run
	mysql test causes connection to crash on 2nd run
	freetds connection writes an error but succeeds in dropping the table
	sybase connection won't even start now

db2 start/stop doesn't work for 7.2
	db2start/db2stop works when run as a given instance owner
	db2 appears to need a license suddenly

setting backlog:
	linux:
		looks like max is 128 on linux 2.0
		2.2/2.4 - /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog
			Default is 1024 for systems with more than 128Mb
			of memory, and 128 for low memory machines.
			If you make it greater than 1024, change
			TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE in include/net/tcp.h to keep
			TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16<=tcp_max_syn_backlog
			and recompile kernel.

Compatibility:
	support @,: or ? for fake bind variables
	rewrite queries with ?'s or @'s for oracle, rewrite
				queries with ?'s or :'s for
	mysql 4.1, 5.0
	daemontools

		ruby api won't build
		postgresql won't configure
		php api won't build
	Solaris x86:

Performance/Code Enhancements:
	call endSession() from perl DBD finish method
	sqlrclient classes shouldn't inherit from inet/unixclientsocket,
		rather should have member variables for each
	make some methods that return int return bool
	implement column flags as a bitmap
	persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it,
				make it available to other sessions
	client-side persistence/socket handoff daemon
	connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	configurable preallocated buffers on the server side
	result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	server side result set caching
	support batch DML in oracle8
	for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client
	seperate modules into standalone builds
	should be a single sqlr-connection daemon that dlopens the
		appropriate database module 
	login errors should be printed on the screen by sqlrconnection class,
		not by individual connections
	api for running queries in the background

Security:
	SSL encryption

Packages:
	FreeBSD
	NetBSD
	OpenBSD
	Solaris

Features:
	support output bind vars and stored procedures in sybase
	could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	mysql drop-in api lacks a few features
	sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained mode 
		and isolation mode when client connects
	sqlr-import/sqlr-export tools
	support vector binds
	handle output binds in Python-DB, Ruby-DBD
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	replication
	query filtering
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	better transaction handling for postgresql
	query/fields cmdline tools need a timeout option
	maximum allowed clob bind value length should be configurable
	odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	solaris init script

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to the fallback
		if the master is overloaded or down
	statistics, stat monitoring interface
	if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up
