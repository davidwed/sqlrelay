slackware package build isn't right
suspend/resumeResultSet doesn't appear to work if result set is done

implement unique/nullable/primary key as a bitmap
use connectstring class to parse/store connectstrings

document that for non-root users, initscripts are installed under $(prefix)
document column flags, getFieldAsXXX, getOutputBindAsXXX
document oracle 8.0/8i temp-blob compile flag

test column flags, getFieldAsXXX, getOutputBindAsXXX
test,document Java "getXXXAsByteArray" methods
tests need to check blob/lobs with binary data in them
test interbase stored procedures

db2 start/stop doesn't work
	db2start/db2stop works when run as a given instance owner

scaling/handoff=pass incompatibility
	setting backlog:
		linux:
			looks like max is 128 on linux 2.0
			2.2/2.4 - /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog
				Default is 1024 for systems with more than 128Mb
				of memory, and 128 for low memory machines.
				If you make it greater than 1024, change
				TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE in include/net/tcp.h to keep
				TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16<=tcp_max_syn_backlog
				and recompile kernel.
			syn cookies - no max backlog
		solaris:
			/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32


handle temp tables properly:
	oracle 8i: "create global temporary table ...
				[on commit preserve rows] (session specific)
				[on commit delete rows] (transaction specific)"
			temporary tables are not dropped when the session ends
			session tables are truncated when sessions end
			transacation tables are truncated on commit/rollback
	sybase: not dropped when session is over
			unless the name begins with a # sign
		are they truncated???
	interbase: ???


Tests:
	zope
	tcl
	odbc tests
	better perldbi/pythondb/rubydbi tests
	test init scripts
	test send query w/length
	test upper/lower/mixed column case methods
	need database reconnect tests
	interbase stored procedure/output bind test
	stored procedure test doesn't work with db2 8.1
	mysql test fails column length test w/some versions
	postgresql test program compile fails on SCO _res defined in
		libsocket/libresolv
	perl api won't build on SCO/Solaris

Compatibility:
	oracle 9.2
	ruby module segfaults on netbsd/openbsd
	python api methods that call PyArg_ParseTuple with an "O" argument 
		don't work on openbsd/netbsd, not exactly sure why
	incorporate pkg-config stuff
	ruby api won't build on SCO
	crypto/ssl lib tests need to look in various places for the library

Documentation:
	getting started docs for MS SQL Server
	getting started docs for odbc
	"how sqlrelay works" with diagrams and animations
	example sqlrelay.conf's for different configurations
	recommended settings for each db, scaling
	performance benchmark charts
	HOWTO for linuxdoc.org
	man pages for everything
	document checkForTempTable()
	fix clientapis.html
	oracle 9.2 installation

Performance:
	persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it, make it available
			to other sessions
	client-side persistence/socket handoff daemon
	connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	configurable preallocated buffers on the server side
	result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	server side result set caching
	support batch DML in oracle8
	for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client

Security:
	address connection hijacking for handoff=reconnect
	SSL encryption

Packages:
	FreeBSD
	NetBSD
	OpenBSD
	Solaris
	OpenServer
	Unixware/OpenUnix

Features:
	support output bind vars and stored procedures in sybase
	could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained mode 
		and isolation mode when client connects
	sqlr-import/sqlr-export tools
	support vector binds
	handle output binds in Perl-DBD, Python-DB, Ruby-DBD
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	replication
	query filtering
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	better transaction handling for postgresql
	query/fields cmdline tools need a timeout option
	maximum allowed clob bind value length should be configurable
	odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	solaris init script
	use const/short/long instead of plain char *, int

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to the fallback
		if the master is overloaded or down
		statistics, stat monitoring interface
	if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up

backends:
	pam_sqlrelay
	mod_auth_sqlrelay for apache
	samba auth module
	bind 9.1 backend
	dhcp backend
	qmail backend
	qpopper port
	bugzilla port

API's:
	wrapper:
		ADODB - have a driver, just need to incorporate it
		PHP DBI
		JDBC
		ODBC
		QT3
		C#
		ADA
	replacement libs for native db api libs - 
		translate msql/mysql/postgresql calls to sqlrelay calls

Native DB Support:
	Informix
	SAP DB
	LocalSQL
	kekedb
	ThinkSQL
	picosql
	shsql

Config Tools:
	gtk2
	QT
	curses
	need keyboard shortcuts
	size should be less than 640x480
	connectstring editor
	wizard
