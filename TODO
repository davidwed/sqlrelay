Bugs:
	* allowing query timeout appears to hang the sqlrelay server
	* PHP pear db only returns 100 rows with this code:
		$query = "SELECT id, name FROM ct_contest ORDER BY name ASC;";
        		$db->setFetchMode(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);
        		$result = $db->query($query);
                		while ($line = $result->fetchRow(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC)) {
                 		print ("\t<option value=\"$line[id]\" $selected>$line[name]</option>\n");
                		print "$line[name]\n";
        		}
        		$result->free();
	* connection daemons have some issue with detaching (I think)
	* some versions of unixodbc don't support SQLConnectW or SQLPrepareW,
			use non-unicode for them
	* just because sqlrelay is compiled against unixodbc which supports
		odbc 3.0 api, individual drivers may not support the 3.0 api,
		so sqlrelay needs to detect this or it needs to at least be
		configurable use SQLGetInfo with SQL_ODBC_API_CONFORMANCE
	* query router "do something"'s
	* get sid working, document or remove it
		how to:
			create db
			create user
			mysql -usiddb -psiddb siddb < siddb
			set up sqlrelay instance to talk to it
			set up another instance to use siddb instance for sid
			populate siddb
			sidparameters:
				sparam=INGRESS - perform ingress filtering
					EGRESS - perform egress filtering
					LISTEN - ???
					VERIFICATION - don't send queries to db
					PREVENTION - send queries to db if ok
				svalue=1/0

			sidingressblist - ingress blacklist
				sql_state - queries to reject
			sidingresswlist - ingress whitelist
				sql_state - queries to accept,
						overrides blacklist
			sidingressldb - ingress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

			sidegressblist - egress blacklist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to reject
			sidegresswlist - egress whitelist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to accept
						overrides blacklist
			sidegressldb - egress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

		what are "parsed results" - something to do with column names...

			sidlog - every query is logged here with a message
					about it
	* if a client connects and the forked listener ends up waiting for a
		connection and the client disconnects, the forked listener has
		no way of knowing that the client has disconnected and can't
		bail
	* semop's can return ENOSPC if the undo list is full which is unhandled
		and causes deadlocks in the sqlr-listeners.  If we get an
		ENOSPC, then we need to send the client an error and the
		sqlr-listener needs to exit.
	* Need to find a way to make connections bleed off.
		If connections=100 and maxconnections=200 and there are
		consistently 150 clients, then the # of connections needs to
		bleed back down to 150 eventually.  Currently, if a spike
		causes it to jump up to 200, then almost all 200 will end up
		staying alive.
	* Need to find a way to re-distribute connections.
		If 2 db's go down and 2nd comes back up first, all log into 2nd
		db and never log out and back into first

Tests:

Documentation:
	* db2 on fc9
	* timequeries parameter
	* how to use new features of Tony/Erik's perl dbi patch
	* getting started with odbc
	* "how sqlrelay works" with diagrams and animations
	* example sqlrelay.conf's for different configurations
	* performance benchmark charts

Performance/Code Enhancements:
	* reset autocommit state when new client logs into sqlrelay
	* NLS_LANG-like issues with other db's?

Features:
	* update python api to create decimals in dictionary
	* update python test to handle python patches
	* incorporate Jens Brey's instantclient patches
	* get odbc driver working better
	* get odbc driver working sufficiently to use with jdbc
	* Perl DBI driver needs to convert bind vars from ?'s to
		db-appropriate format like PHP Pear DB driver does
	* Non C/C++ api's need a method to close cursors.  Specifically, bind
		cursors cannot be closed manually and must be garbage collected.
		It's not an issue for memory, but rather a server-side cursor
		will be occupied until it's garbage collected.  On C/C++ you
		can just delete it.

Documentation:

Performance/Code Enhancements:
	* db2 first query fails and forces relogin unless detached first
		which causes problems if reloginatstart is not set
		using tcp connections fixes this but is slower
	* Don't fork listener children, use listen() backlog instead
		linux:
			looks like max is 128 on linux 2.0
			2.2/2.4 - /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog
				Default is 1024 for systems with more than 128Mb
				of memory, and 128 for low memory machines.
				If you make it greater than 1024, change
				TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE in include/net/tcp.h to keep
				TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16<=tcp_max_syn_backlog
				and recompile kernel.
			syn cookies - no max backlog
		solaris:
			/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32
	* perl apis -> CPAN
	* client connect timeout
	* store passwords in encrypted form in the config file
	* call endSession() from perl DBD finish method
	* implement column flags as a bitmap
	* persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it,
				make it available to other sessions
	* connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	* api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	* api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	* result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	* server side result set caching
	* support batch DML in oracle8
	* for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client
	* seperate modules into standalone builds
	* should be a single sqlr-connection daemon that dlopens the
		appropriate database module 
	* login errors should be printed on the screen by sqlrconnection class,
		not by individual connections
	* api for running queries in the background
		(asynchronous queries w/timeouts)
	* use async queries by default, even if the client runs a synchronous
		query, so the query can be cancelled if the client disconnects
	* support freetds/sybase ct_con_prop/encryption
	* use bandwidth delay product to set tcp send/receive buffer sizes

Features:
	* SSL encryption
	* verbose mode for export/import
	* daemontools compatibility
	* figure out how to get the drop-in client compiled into the mysql PHP
		module like the mysql native client is
	* query router support accessing different db's by specifying a
		different user/password
	* query router support accessing different db's by specifying which
		db to use
	* make fetch buffer sizes run-time configurable for db2 and sybase
	* add "quoting method" call to api, call mysql native function,
		(mysql_escape_string()/mysql_real_escape_string())
	* not sure about other db's
	* hack on postgresql's ecpg to emit SQL Relay code rather than
		Postgresql code
	* sqlite binds, sqlite utf-8/utf-16 functions
	* pythondb output bind variables?
	* zope bind variables?
	* 2-phase commit, use it in query router
	* use PAM if possible as alternative to defining users in sqlrelay.conf
	* support stored procedures that return result sets in interbase, db2
	* could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	* postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	* postgresql drop-in needs to parse out ; delimited queries for db's
		that don't support that, execute them seperately
	* mysql drop-in api lacks a few features, stmt functions need
		to be updated
	* sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained
		mode and isolation mode when client connects
	* datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes (oracle collections)
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	* front end replication
	* quotas
	* logging
	* handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	* implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	* better transaction handling for postgresql
	* odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	* solaris init script
	* api needs to expose integer column types
	* call dontGetColumnInfo() when doing fetchrow_array calls in DBD driver
	* Some databases (like postgresql) are in auto-commit mode unless you
		manually begin a transaction.  SQL Relay calls commit/rollback
		at the end of a client session, even if the database is in
		auto-commit mode.  For postgresql at least, this is expensive.
		It should only call commit/rollback if the database isn't in
		auto-commit mode.
	* date object binds
	* DML/DDL caching - if db is down, accept queries and run them when the
		db comes back up

Availability:
	* connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	* failover - master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to
		the fallback if the master is overloaded or down
	* if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up

API's:
	* C#
	* Ruby-on-rails adapter

Drop-in replacement libraries:
	* Oracle OCI7/8
	* Sybase-ct
	* Interbase
