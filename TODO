docs:
	mysql comes with solaris companion cd's except for solaris 8
	when installing mysql on solaris 8 from mysql's site, first need to
	create a wheel group

	postgresql 7.x and 8 may have "ident sameuser" rather than "trust"
	by default, need to add entry for local subnet, not just 127.0.0.0 
	for 7.x and 8, need to add listen_addresses = '*' in postgresql.conf,
		not tcpip_socket

solaris 9:
	ruby api compile fails
	tries to look in /opt/sfw/lib/mysql/.libs for libmysqlclient
		(libtool looks in .libs if -Lpath doesn't end in lib)
		(seems like I fixed this once before by explicitly telling
			it to link against /opt/sfw/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so)
		but it works on other platforms...?

solaris 10:
	tcl api compile fails

cygwin:
	perl api fails to generate a dll
	linking against non-cygwin dll's creates programs that hang

--enable-efence and --disable-efence both enable efence!

freebsd-6:
	doesn't find firebird
		/usr/local/include/gds.h
		/usr/local/lib/libfbclient.so
		/usr/local/lib/libgds.so

openbsd-3.8:
	php api compile fails

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

interbase fails float output bind test, prec/scale issue?

Tru64 -
	unix sockets don't work, looks like a byte-order translation issue
	can't start more than 1 cursor, looks like out-of-memory

perl apis -> CPAN

get sid working, document
	how to:
		create db
		create user
		mysql -usiddb -psiddb siddb < siddb
		set up sqlrelay instance to talk to it
		set up another instance to use siddb instance for sid
		populate siddb
			sidparameters:
				sparam=INGRESS - perform ingress filtering
					EGRESS - perform egress filtering
					LISTEN - ???
					VERIFICATION - don't send queries to db
					PREVENTION - send queries to db if ok
				svalue=1/0

			sidingressblist - ingress blacklist
				sql_state - queries to reject
			sidingresswlist - ingress whitelist
				sql_state - queries to accept,
						overrides blacklist
			sidingressldb - ingress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

			sidegressblist - egress blacklist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to reject
			sidegresswlist - egress whitelist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to accept
						overrides blacklist
			sidegressldb - egress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

	what are "parsed results" - something to do with column names...

			sidlog - every query is logged here with a message
					about it

setting backlog:
	linux:
		looks like max is 128 on linux 2.0
		2.2/2.4 - /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog
			Default is 1024 for systems with more than 128Mb
			of memory, and 128 for low memory machines.
			If you make it greater than 1024, change
			TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE in include/net/tcp.h to keep
			TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16<=tcp_max_syn_backlog
			and recompile kernel.
		syn cookies - no max backlog

cygwin:
	mysql connection crashes on function call
	how to install as a service?
	languages:
		VB wrapper
		how to build a php extension?
			1) need php source 
		active state python
			http://sebsauvage.net/python/mingw.html
		non-cygwin ruby
			creates funny CFLAGS
		active state perl
			PERL5LIB env var points to Oracle's perl installation
			perl -V:prefix return C:\Perl
		active state tcl
			no doubt will have similar problems...

		installing packages

Compatibility:
	* implement interbase dead-db/relogin
	* support libmysqlclient_r
	* daemontools
	* mysql 4.1, 5.0 - bind vars
	* rename interbase stuff firebird
	* figure out how to get the drop-in client compiled into the mysql PHP
		module like the mysql native client is

Documentation:
	* snippets from tnsnames.ora can be used as ORACLE_SID
	* how to use new features of Tony/Erik's perl dbi patch
	* issue with sqlrelay.conf permissions and runasuser="nobody"
	* getting started with odbc

Performance/Code Enhancements:
	* NLS_LANG-like issues with other db's?
	* client connect timeout
	* store passwords in encrypted form in the config file
	* call endSession() from perl DBD finish method
	* implement column flags as a bitmap
	* persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it,
				make it available to other sessions
	* connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	* api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	* api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	* result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	* server side result set caching
	* support batch DML in oracle8
	* for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client
	* seperate modules into standalone builds
	* should be a single sqlr-connection daemon that dlopens the
		appropriate database module 
	* login errors should be printed on the screen by sqlrconnection class,
		not by individual connections
	* api for running queries in the background
		(asynchronous queries w/timeouts)
	* use async queries by default, even if the client runs a synchronous
		query, so the query can be cancelled if the client disconnects
	* support freetds/sybase ct_con_prop/encryption

Security:
	* SSL encryption

Packages:
	* FreeBSD
	* NetBSD
	* OpenBSD
	* Solaris
	* OpenServer
	* Unixware/OpenUnix

Features:
	* distribute selects to slaves, dml/ddl to master:
		If SQL Relay is running in master/slave mode, then when a
		client connects to the listener, the listener could hand it off
		to 2 sqlr-connections.  The client could keep track of these
		2 sqlr-connections and send non-selects to the master and
		selects to the slave.  The application will need to be aware
		that it's operating in a master/slave environment though, and
		either turn on autocommit or execute commit's manually.

		(Since the client needs to wait for 2 connections, the potential
		for the classic dining philosophers deadlock problem exists
		and will need to be addressed)
		
		To decide which database is the master, the sqlr-listener will
		need to know which connectionid is associated with that
		database.  It will detect if the master has gone down and
		attempt to reconnect.  Potentially, the sqlr-listener could
		listen on a socket for "promote/demote" instructions from other
		software.  If the master has gone down and the sqlr-listener
		receives a "demote master, promote slave" instruction and
		a set of connectionids and act accordingly.  The reverse
		could happen when the master comes back up.

	* use PAM if possible as alternative to defining users in sqlrelay.conf
	* support stored procedures that return result sets in
		sybase, interbase, db2
	* could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	* postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	* postgresql drop-in needs to parse out ; delimited queries for db's
		that don't support that, execute them seperately
	* mysql drop-in api lacks a few features
	* sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained
		mode and isolation mode when client connects
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes (oracle collections)
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	front end replication
	query filtering
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	better transaction handling for postgresql
	query/fields cmdline tools need a timeout option
	odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	solaris init script
	api needs to expose integer column types
	call dontGetColumnInfo() when doing fetchrow_array calls in DBD driver
	Some databases (like postgresql) are in auto-commit mode unless you
		manually begin a transaction.  SQL Relay calls commit/rollback
		at the end of a client session, even if the database is in
		auto-commit mode.  For postgresql at least, this is expensive.
		It should only call commit/rollback if the database isn't in
		auto-commit mode.
	need a "relay ping" method that tries to connect to the SQL Relay
		server and returns true/false if that was possible or not

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	failover - master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to
		the fallback if the master is overloaded or down
	statistics, stat monitoring interface
	if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up
