hack on postgresql's ecpg to emit SQL Relay code rather than Postgresql code

perl apis -> CPAN

mysql 4.1.2:
	non c++ tests

mysql 5.x
	implement clob/blob output bind vars
	test stored procedures
	test output binds
	document using stored procedures

postgresql/mysql connetions shouldn't try to use bind variables against older
	database versions

implement interbase dead-db/relogin

query router:
	query filtering
	investigate 2 phase commit
	document

query/fields cmdline tools need a timeout option

need a "relay ping" method that tries to connect to the SQL Relay
		server and returns true/false if that was possible or not

get sid working, document
	how to:
		create db
		create user
		mysql -usiddb -psiddb siddb < siddb
		set up sqlrelay instance to talk to it
		set up another instance to use siddb instance for sid
		populate siddb
			sidparameters:
				sparam=INGRESS - perform ingress filtering
					EGRESS - perform egress filtering
					LISTEN - ???
					VERIFICATION - don't send queries to db
					PREVENTION - send queries to db if ok
				svalue=1/0

			sidingressblist - ingress blacklist
				sql_state - queries to reject
			sidingresswlist - ingress whitelist
				sql_state - queries to accept,
						overrides blacklist
			sidingressldb - ingress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

			sidegressblist - egress blacklist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to reject
			sidegresswlist - egress whitelist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to accept
						overrides blacklist
			sidegressldb - egress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

	what are "parsed results" - something to do with column names...

			sidlog - every query is logged here with a message
					about it

solaris 8:
	libgcc_s not found

solaris 9:
	tries to look in /opt/sfw/lib/mysql/.libs for libmysqlclient
		(libtool looks in .libs if -Lpath doesn't end in lib)
		but it works on other platforms...?
		links fine, works after manually modifying config.mk to
		link directly against the .so file

openbsd-3.8
	handoff="pass" doesn't work

cygwin
	handoff="pass" doesn't work

php debug doesn't print out numbers because zend_printf doesn't support %ld's

interbase fails float output bind test, prec/scale issue?

Tru64 -
	unix sockets don't work, looks like a byte-order translation issue
	can't start more than 1 cursor, looks like out-of-memory

setting backlog:
	linux:
		looks like max is 128 on linux 2.0
		2.2/2.4 - /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog
			Default is 1024 for systems with more than 128Mb
			of memory, and 128 for low memory machines.
			If you make it greater than 1024, change
			TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE in include/net/tcp.h to keep
			TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16<=tcp_max_syn_backlog
			and recompile kernel.
		syn cookies - no max backlog
	solaris:
		/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32

	stored procedures for mysql-5.0
	adodb using peardb driver

	odbc tests
	mysql_stmt calls in drop-in library
	better pythondb/rubydbi tests
	test init scripts
	test send query w/length
	test upper/lower/mixed column case methods
	need database reconnect tests
	column flags
	getFieldAsXXX
	getOutputBindAsXXX

cygwin:
	how to use with non-cygwin dll's?
	how to install as a service?
	languages:
		VB wrapper
		how to build a php extension?
			1) need php source 
		active state python
			http://sebsauvage.net/python/mingw.html
		non-cygwin ruby
			creates funny CFLAGS
		active state perl
			PERL5LIB env var points to Oracle's perl installation
			perl -V:prefix return C:\Perl
		active state tcl
			no doubt will have similar problems...
			-I/cygdrive/Tcl/include
			-L/cygdrive/c/Tcl/lib -ltcl84 -ltclstub84
		zope
			/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Zope-2.7.1/lib/python/Products
	databases:
		sqlite
			.dll and .def file wherever
		msql
			won't build, need older bison
	doc
		installing packages
		optional cygwin components
		running sqlrelay clients
		add path to mysql dll to PATH

Compatibility:
	* daemontools
	* rename interbase stuff firebird
	* figure out how to get the drop-in client compiled into the mysql PHP
		module like the mysql native client is

Documentation:
	* snippets from tnsnames.ora can be used as ORACLE_SID
	* how to use new features of Tony/Erik's perl dbi patch
	* issue with sqlrelay.conf permissions and runasuser="nobody"
	* getting started with odbc
	* how to use pear db driver with adodb
	* "how sqlrelay works" with diagrams and animations
	* example sqlrelay.conf's for different configurations
	* performance benchmark charts
	* HOWTO for linuxdoc.org
	* man pages for everything
	* document tds version for various versions of MSSQL/Sybase

Performance/Code Enhancements:
	* NLS_LANG-like issues with other db's?
	* client connect timeout
	* store passwords in encrypted form in the config file
	* call endSession() from perl DBD finish method
	* implement column flags as a bitmap
	* persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it,
				make it available to other sessions
	* connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	* api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	* api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	* result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	* server side result set caching
	* support batch DML in oracle8
	* for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client
	* seperate modules into standalone builds
	* should be a single sqlr-connection daemon that dlopens the
		appropriate database module 
	* login errors should be printed on the screen by sqlrconnection class,
		not by individual connections
	* api for running queries in the background
		(asynchronous queries w/timeouts)
	* use async queries by default, even if the client runs a synchronous
		query, so the query can be cancelled if the client disconnects
	* support freetds/sybase ct_con_prop/encryption
	* use bandwidth delay product to set tcp send/receive buffer sizes

Security:
	* SSL encryption

Features:
	* use PAM if possible as alternative to defining users in sqlrelay.conf
	* support stored procedures that return result sets in
		sybase, interbase, db2
	* could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	* postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	* postgresql drop-in needs to parse out ; delimited queries for db's
		that don't support that, execute them seperately
	* mysql drop-in api lacks a few features, stmt functions need
		to be updated
	* sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained
		mode and isolation mode when client connects
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes (oracle collections)
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	front end replication
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	better transaction handling for postgresql
	odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	solaris init script
	api needs to expose integer column types
	call dontGetColumnInfo() when doing fetchrow_array calls in DBD driver
	Some databases (like postgresql) are in auto-commit mode unless you
		manually begin a transaction.  SQL Relay calls commit/rollback
		at the end of a client session, even if the database is in
		auto-commit mode.  For postgresql at least, this is expensive.
		It should only call commit/rollback if the database isn't in
		auto-commit mode.

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	failover - master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to
		the fallback if the master is overloaded or down
	statistics, stat monitoring interface
	if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up

backends:
	pam_sqlrelay
	mod_auth_sqlrelay for apache
	samba auth module
	bind 9.1 backend
	dhcp backend
	qmail backend
	qpopper port
	bugzilla port
	litesql
