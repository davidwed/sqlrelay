db2 first query fails and forces relogin unless detached first which causes
	problems if reloginatstart is not set
router test fails, bind by name fails, wrong # of columns

write a doc:
	how to load-balance a mysql/postgresql app using
	drop-in-replacement lib and query routing

add "quoting method" call to api, call mysql native function,
	(mysql_escape_string()/mysql_real_escape_string())
	not sure about other db's

Need to find a way to make connections bleed off.
	If connections=100 and maxconnections=200 and there are consistently
		150 clients, then the # of connections needs to bleed back
		down to 150 eventually.  Currently, if a spike causes it to
		jump up to 200, then almost all 200 will end up staying alive.

Need to find a way to re-distribute connections.
	If 2 db's go down and 2nd comes back up first, all log into 2nd db and
	never log out and back into first

test php pear db bind formats

sqlite binds, sqlite utf-8/utf-16 functions

perl doesn't build on openbsd 4

support oracle OS authentication
	create user ops$<os_username> identified externally

ruby install fails on solaris 10

query router:
	"do something"'s
	support accessing different db's by specifying a different user/password
	support accessing different db's by specifying which db to use

semop's can return ENOSPC if the undo list is full which is unhandled and causes
	deadlocks in the sqlr-listeners.  If we get an ENOSPC, then we need to
	send the client an error and the sqlr-listener needs to exit.

if a client connects and the forked listener ends up waiting for a connection
	and the client disconnects, the forked listener has no way of knowing
	that the client has disconnected and can't bail

get sid working, document
	how to:
		create db
		create user
		mysql -usiddb -psiddb siddb < siddb
		set up sqlrelay instance to talk to it
		set up another instance to use siddb instance for sid
		populate siddb
			sidparameters:
				sparam=INGRESS - perform ingress filtering
					EGRESS - perform egress filtering
					LISTEN - ???
					VERIFICATION - don't send queries to db
					PREVENTION - send queries to db if ok
				svalue=1/0

			sidingressblist - ingress blacklist
				sql_state - queries to reject
			sidingresswlist - ingress whitelist
				sql_state - queries to accept,
						overrides blacklist
			sidingressldb - ingress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

			sidegressblist - egress blacklist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to reject
			sidegresswlist - egress whitelist
				sql_state - "parsed results" to accept
						overrides blacklist
			sidegressldb - egress learning database
				parsed_sql - ???

	what are "parsed results" - something to do with column names...

			sidlog - every query is logged here with a message
					about it

solaris 8:

solaris 9:
	tries to look in /opt/sfw/lib/mysql/.libs for libmysqlclient
		(libtool looks in .libs if -Lpath doesn't end in lib)
		but it works on other platforms...?
		links fine, works after manually modifying config.mk to
		link directly against the .so file

cygwin:

		how to build a php extension?
			1) need php source

		non-cygwin ruby
			creates funny CFLAGS
		active state perl
			PERL5LIB env var points to Oracle's perl installation

		active state tcl
			no doubt will have similar problems...

Compatibility:
	* daemontools
	* figure out how to get the drop-in client compiled into the mysql PHP
		module like the mysql native client is

Documentation:
	* snippets from tnsnames.ora can be used as ORACLE_SID
	* how to use new features of Tony/Erik's perl dbi patch
	* issue with sqlrelay.conf permissions and runasuser="nobody"
	* getting started with odbc
	* "how sqlrelay works" with diagrams and animations
	* example sqlrelay.conf's for different configurations
	* performance benchmark charts
	* HOWTO for linuxdoc.org
	* man pages for everything
	* document tds version for various versions of MSSQL/Sybase

Performance/Code Enhancements:
	* NLS_LANG-like issues with other db's?
	* client connect timeout
	* store passwords in encrypted form in the config file
	* call endSession() from perl DBD finish method
	* implement column flags as a bitmap
	* persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it,
				make it available to other sessions
	* connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	* api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	* api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	* result set compression during transmission for distant relays
	* server side result set caching
	* support batch DML in oracle8
	* for databases that can return non-strings in their result sets, 
		send non strings to client
	* seperate modules into standalone builds
	* should be a single sqlr-connection daemon that dlopens the
		appropriate database module 
	* login errors should be printed on the screen by sqlrconnection class,
		not by individual connections
	* api for running queries in the background
		(asynchronous queries w/timeouts)
	* use async queries by default, even if the client runs a synchronous
		query, so the query can be cancelled if the client disconnects
	* support freetds/sybase ct_con_prop/encryption
	* use bandwidth delay product to set tcp send/receive buffer sizes

Security:
	* SSL encryption

Features:
	* 2-phase commit, use it in query router
	* use PAM if possible as alternative to defining users in sqlrelay.conf
	* support stored procedures that return result sets in interbase, db2
	* could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	* postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	* postgresql drop-in needs to parse out ; delimited queries for db's
		that don't support that, execute them seperately
	* mysql drop-in api lacks a few features, stmt functions need
		to be updated
	* sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained
		mode and isolation mode when client connects
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes (oracle collections)
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	front end replication
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	better transaction handling for postgresql
	odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	solaris init script
	api needs to expose integer column types
	call dontGetColumnInfo() when doing fetchrow_array calls in DBD driver
	Some databases (like postgresql) are in auto-commit mode unless you
		manually begin a transaction.  SQL Relay calls commit/rollback
		at the end of a client session, even if the database is in
		auto-commit mode.  For postgresql at least, this is expensive.
		It should only call commit/rollback if the database isn't in
		auto-commit mode.
	date object binds

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	failover - master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to
		the fallback if the master is overloaded or down
	if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up

	samba auth module
