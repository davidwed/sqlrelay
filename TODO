Problem #1:

I am having a problem with SQL Relay hanging once it
starts to scale
the number of connections. I am running this on a
large search based
website but it just keeps locking up on me. I see it
begin to scale
the connections and then reduce the connections and
etc, but after
about 5-10 minutes my searches start timing out and
sql relay becomes
unresponsive. I have pasted my instance for this
connection below. If
someonecould please help me correct this issue it
would be greatly
appreciated.

<instance id="db2" port="9001"
socket="/tmp/db2.socket"
dbase="oracle8" connections="50" maxconnections="100"
maxqueuelength="5"
growby="1" ttl="60" endofsession="commit"
sessiontimeout="600"
runasuser="nobody" runasgroup="nobody" cursors="5"
authtier="listener"
handoff="pass" deniedips=""
allowedips="^192\.168\.8\.(12|16)$" debug="">
<users>
<user user="db2" password="db2"/>
</users>
<connections>
<connection connectionid="db2"
string="user=user;password=password;oracle_sid=oracle_sid;"
metric="1"/>
</connections>
</instance>

sqlr-connection running as nobody/nobody complains about trying to switch to
	the nobody group

people have been reporting freetds problems

php module needs to clean itself up (close connections) if the script dies

CFLAGS="-framework Python" to get python API to compile on OS X

perl apis -> CPAN

api needs to expose integer column types

numeric output bind variables

does setResultSetBufferSize prevent PythonDB, Perl DBI, etc. from fetching more
	than 100 rows?

mysql 4.1, 5.0 - bind vars
postgresql 8 - bind vars

call dontGetColumnInfo() when doing fetchrow_array calls in DBD driver

	store passwords in encrypted form in the config file
	use python distutils to build python
	call endSession() from perl DBD finish method
	sqlrclient classes shouldn't inherit from inet/unixclientsocket,
		rather should have member variables for each
	implement column flags as a bitmap
	persistent cursors - parse query, attach an id to it,
				make it available to other sessions
	client-side persistence/socket handoff daemon
	connection daemons could put buffers in shared memory and
		clients could send queries, access buffers using 
		shared memory and semaphores instead of unix sockets
	api methods to use preallocated buffers for result sets
	api methods for configuring optimistic buffer sizes
	configurable preallocated buffers on the server side

	SSL encryption

Packages:
	FreeBSD
	NetBSD

	Solaris
	OpenServer
	Unixware/OpenUnix

Features:
	distribute selects to slaves, dml/ddl to master:
		If SQL Relay is running in master/slave mode, then when a
		client connects to the listener, the listener could hand it off
		to 2 sqlr-connections.  The client could keep track of these
		2 sqlr-connections and send non-selects to the master and
		selects to the slave.  The application will need to be aware
		that it's operating in a master/slave environment though, and
		either turn on autocommit or execute commit's manually.

		(Since the client needs to wait for 2 connections, the potential
		for the classic dining philosophers deadlock problem exists
		and will need to be addressed)
		
		To decide which database is the master, the sqlr-listener will
		need to know which connectionid is associated with that
		database.  It will detect if the master has gone down and
		attempt to reconnect.  Potentially, the sqlr-listener could
		listen on a socket for "promote/demote" instructions from other
		software.  If the master has gone down and the sqlr-listener
		receives a "demote master, promote slave" instruction and
		a set of connectionids and act accordingly.  The reverse
		could happen when the master comes back up.

	use PAM if possible as alternative to defining users in sqlrelay.conf
	support stored procedures that return result sets in
		sybase, interbase, db2
	support non-string output binds sybase stored procedures
	could debug logs be logrotate compatible?
	postgresql drop-in api lacks many features
	postgresql drop-in needs to parse out ; delimited queries for db's
		that don't support that, execute them seperately
	mysql drop-in api lacks a few features
	sybase/freetds (possibly others) need options for setting chained mode 
		and isolation mode when client connects
	sqlr-import/sqlr-export tools
	support vector binds
	handle output binds in Python-DB, Ruby-DBD
	datatype support:
		handle binary data correctly in all databases
		identical long/lob datatype support in all databases
		more advanced long/lob datatype support
		support for array datatypes
		handle blobs, quads in interbase
		handle timestamps
		handle enum types in mysql
	replication
	query filtering
	quotas
	logging
	handle commit/rollback for named transactions
	implement API's that handle errors with exceptions
	better transaction handling for postgresql
	query/fields cmdline tools need a timeout option
	maximum allowed clob bind value length should be configurable
	odbc connection should check the odbc definition
		for connect string arguments - SQLBrowseConnect
	solaris init script

Availability:
	connections should ping database server every so often to make sure
		it's up, if it's not, relogin
	master, fallback databases, where connection only goes to the fallback
		if the master is overloaded or down
	statistics, stat monitoring interface
	if a connection dies mysteriously, a new one should fire up
