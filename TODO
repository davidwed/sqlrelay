address Matthias Klose's concerns:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi,

again, I updated the Debian packages. some things:

- my understanding of specifiying DESTDIR for the install target is,
  that _all_ things are installed under this directory. Unfortunately
  most of the modules stuff for other languages is not.

- you cannot overwrite the install location of the Perl stuff

- Each language module has a runtime path compiled in: the path of
  it's installation. IMO this is nonsense. what should be searched in
  this path?

  I think we did talk about the build of loadable modules. I think
  at least for python you should use the "python" way to build the
  module (using distutils). I don't know the other languages good enough ...

	Matthias

PS: Attached the postprocessing I need to do for a "proper" DESTDIR
installation. what I would like to do:

	$(MAKE) DESTDIR=`pwd`/debian/tmp install

instead of:

        $(MAKE) \
                DESTDIR=`pwd`/debian/tmp \
                prefix=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr/share \
                exec_prefix=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr \
                includedir=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr/include \
                libdir=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr/lib \

                install
