= Ubuntu 16.04 - Basic SQL Relay Client =

This how-to walks through:

* Installing a basic SQL Relay client on an Ubuntu 16.04 system
* Using it to access a database via an SQL Relay server, installed on another system

It assumes that two systems have been set up and configured as follows:

'''SQL Relay client'''

* Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop operating system
* //apt upgrade// was run post-install
* A user with sudo privileges has desktop access to the system

'''SQL Relay server'''

* Any operating system that supports SQL Relay server, accessible as:
 * Hostname: //sqlrserver//
 * Port: 9000
 * Username: //sqlruser//
 * Password: //sqlrpassword//


=== Install Prerequisite Software ===

On the SQL Relay client system, run the following command to install the prerequisite software packages:

{{{
sudo apt install libedit-dev libssl-dev libkrb5-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
}}}


=== Build and Install SQL Relay Client Software ===

On the SQL Relay client system, download current .tar.gz files of SQL Relay and Rudiments from the '''Source Distribution''' section of [http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/download.html the SQL Relay Downloads page].

Extract, build, and install the software as follows:

{{{
tar xfz rudiments-*.tar.gz
cd rudiments-*
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
tar xfz sqlrelay-*.tar.gz
cd sqlrelay-*
./configure --disable-server
make
sudo make install
}}}


=== Update the Environment ===

Create /etc/profile.d/firstworks.sh with the following contents:

{{{
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/firstworks/bin
}}}

Create /etc/ld.so.conf.d/firstworks.conf with the following contents:

{{{
/usr/local/firstworks/lib
}}}

Then run:

{{{
sudo /sbin/ldconfig
}}}

Exit and log back in to apply the updates to the environment.


=== Verify Connectivity to the SQL Relay Server ===

To verfiy DNS resolution of the SQL Relay server hostname, run:

{{{
ping -c1 sqlrserver
}}}

It should respond with output like the following:

{{{
PING sqlrserver.firstworks.com (192.168.123.6) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from sqlrserver.firstworks.com (192.168.123.6): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.259 ms

--- sqlrserver.firstworks.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.259/0.259/0.259/0.000 ms
}}}

If not, then some typical problems and solutions include:

* The hostname doesn't resolve to an IP address
 * Add an entry in /etc/hosts with the hostname and IP address of the SQL Relay server
 * Update your local DNS configuration with the hostname and IP address of the SQL Relay server
* The SQL Relay server isn't running
 * Verify that the SQL Relay server is running
* The SQL Relay server is blocked behind a firewall
 * Open a hole in the firewall to the SQL Relay server

To verify that you can log into the SQL Relay server and run queries, run the //sqlrsh// client as follows:

{{{
sqlrsh -host sqlrserver -user sqlruser -password sqlrpassword
}}}

It should respond with the following output and prompt:

{{{
sqlrsh - Version 1.2.0
        Connected to: sqlrserver:9000 as sqlruser

        type help; for help.

0>
}}}

Try a simple query, like:

{{{
select 'hello world' from dual;
}}}

( Note: this query is valid for an Oracle database, if the SQL Relay server is connected to a different database, then you may have to use a slightly different query )

It should respond with output and a prompt similar to the following:

{{{
'HELLOWORLD'
============
hello world

        Rows Returned   : 1
        Fields Returned : 1
        Elapsed Time    : 0.006065 sec

0>
}}}

There shouldn't be any errors or warnings, but if there are, then some typical problems and solutions include:

* "Couldn't connect to the listener." - the SQL Relay server probably isn't running
 * Restart the SQL Relay server
* "Authentication Error." - the user or password specified on the sqlrsh command line don't match the user or password in the user tag of the sqlrelay.conf file
 * Specify the correct user or password on the sqlrsh command line
 * Update the sqlrelay.conf file and restart SQL Relay
* A SQL error of some kind
 * Try a different query

Congratulations!  If you made it to this point, the SQL Relay server is configured correctly.

=== Uninstallation ===

If, for some reason, you need to completely uninstall SQL Relay, then run the following commands from the directory that the source trees were extracted to:

{{{
cd sqlrelay-*
sudo make uninstall
cd ../rudiments-*
sudo make uninstall
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/firstworks
}}}
