This how-to walks through:

* Installing an SQL Relay server on a Windows system
* Configuring a TLS-secured connection between the SQL Relay server and an MS SQL Server database with a .pfx file
* Configuring the SQL Relay server for TLS-secured communications with SQL Relay clients

It assumes that two systems have been set up and configured as follows:

'''SQL Relay server'''

* 64-bit Windows 7 or higher operating system
* A user with Administrator privileges has console or Remote Desktop access to the system
* A browser is installed and configured to be able to access the web without significant restrictions
* The host name of the server is set to //sqlrserver//
* The fully qualified domain name of the server is //sqlrserver.firstworks.com//

'''MS SQL Server database server'''

* Any operating system that supports MS SQL Server 2012 or higher
* MS SQL Server 2012 or higher, accessible as:
 * Hostname: //mssql//
 * Port: 1433
 * SQL Server Authentication:
  * Username: //mssqluser//
  * Password: //mssqlpassword//

This how-to also assumes that a certificate has been created to secure the SQL Relay server, which was signed by an Certificate Authority internal to the organization, rather than a well-known Certificate Authority, and:

* The CA cert is available as ca.pfx
* The SQL Relay server certificate was created with the Common Name or a Subject Alternative Name set to //sqlrserver.firstworks.com//
* A certificate store file sqlrelay.pfx has been created containing:
 * The SQL Relay server certificate
 * The private key
 * The CA certificate

== Install Rudiments and SQL Relay Packages ==

Download current .zip files of the '''SQL Relay Binary Distribution for Windows''' from the '''Binary Distributions''' section of the [http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/download.html the SQL Relay Downloads page] to the SQL Relay server Desktop.

Extract and install the software as follows:

* Right-click on sqlrelay-binary-distribution-1.2.0.zip and select Extract All...
* Click Extract
* Wait for extraction to finish and to pop up a window containing the extracted files
* Navigate to sqlrelay-binary-distribution-1.2.0\x64\rudiments
* Double-click setup
* If you get an Open File - Security Warning then click Run
* In the setup wizard...
 * On the '''Welcome to the Firstworks Rudiments (64-bit) Setup Wizard''' screen, click Next
 * On the '''Select Installation Folder''' screen, click Next
 * On the '''Confirm Installation''' screen, click Next
 * The '''Installing Firstworks Rudiments (64-bit)''' screen will show installation progress
 * On the '''Installation Complete''' screen, click Close
* Navigate up and into sqlrelay-binary-distribution-1.2.0\x64\sqlrelay
* Double-click setup
* If you get an Open File - Security Warning then click Run
* In the setup wizard...
 * On the '''Welcome to the Firstworks SQL Relay (64-bit) Setup Wizard''' screen, click Next
 * On the '''Select Installation Folder''' screen, click Next
 * On the '''Confirm Installation''' screen, click Next
 * The '''Installing Firstworks SQL Relay (64-bit)''' screen will show installation progress
 * On the '''Installation Complete''' screen, click Close
* Close the sqlrelay-binary-distribution-1.2.0 file manager window.

It's now safe to trash the sqlrelay-binary-distribution-1.2.0 folder and zip.

== Configure an ODBC DSN ==

SQL Relay will use ODBC to connect to the database.

To configure a DSN for a TLS-encrypted ODBC connection to MS SQL Server:

* Press Windows-key-R
* Type //odbcad32// and hit return
* In the '''ODBC Data Source Administrator'''
 * Select the System DSN tab
 * Click Add...
 * Select SQL Server Native Client 11.0
 * Click Finish
 * In the '''Create a New Data Source to SQL Server''' dialog
  * Enter //mssql// for Name
  * Enter //mssql// for Server
  * Click Next
  * Click the radio button next to With SQL Server authentication...
  * Enter //mssqluser// for Login ID
  * Enter //mssqlpassword// for Password
  * Click Next
  * Click Next
  * Check Use strong encryption for data
  * Click Finish
  * Click OK
 * Click OK

== Configure SQL Relay ==

To configure SQL Relay:

* Install sqlrelay.pfx as C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\sqlrelay.pfx
* Install ca.pfx as C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\ca.pfx
* Create the file C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\sqlrelay.conf.d\mssql.conf with the following contents:

{{{
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;instances&gt;
    &lt;instance id="sample" dbase="odbc"
            tls="yes" tlscert="C:\\Program Files\\Firstworks\\etc\\sqlrelay.pfx"&gt;
        &lt;users&gt;
            &lt;user user="sqlruser" password="sqlrpassword"/&gt;
        &lt;/users&gt;
        &lt;connections&gt;
            &lt;connection string="dsn=mssql;user=mssqluser;password=mssqlpassword"/&gt;
        &lt;/connections&gt;
    &lt;/instance&gt;
&lt;/instances&gt;
}}}

== Start SQL Relay ==

Start SQL Relay by running:

{{{
sqlr-start -id sample
}}}

It should open a new window with the following output:

{{{
Starting listener:
  sqlr-listener -id sample -localstatedir C:\Program Files\Firstworks\var\

Starting 5 connections to sample-0 :
  sqlr-connection -id sample -connectionid sample-0 -localstatedir C:\Program Files\Firstworks\var\
  sqlr-connection -id sample -connectionid sample-0 -localstatedir C:\Program Files\Firstworks\var\
  sqlr-connection -id sample -connectionid sample-0 -localstatedir C:\Program Files\Firstworks\var\
  sqlr-connection -id sample -connectionid sample-0 -localstatedir C:\Program Files\Firstworks\var\
  sqlr-connection -id sample -connectionid sample-0 -localstatedir C:\Program Files\Firstworks\var\
}}}

There shouldn't be any errors or warnings, but if there are, then there is probably a configuration problem of some kind.  Adjust mssql.conf or the ODBC DSN as appropriate.

If you need to restart the SQL Relay server, run:

{{{
sqlr-stop
sqlr-start -id sample
}}}

== Verify SQL Relay ==

To verify that the SQL Relay processes are running:

* Press Windows-key-R
* Type //taskmgr// and hit return
* Select the Processes tab

There should be 1 sqlr-listener process and 5 sqlr-connection processes.

To verify that you can log into the SQL Relay server and run queries, run the //sqlrsh// client as follows:

{{{
sqlrsh -host localhost -user sqlruser -password sqlrpassword -tls -tlsverify ca+host -tlsca "C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\ca.pfx"
}}}

It should respond with the following output and prompt:

{{{
sqlrsh - Version 1.2.0
        Connected to: localhost:9000 as sqlruser

        type help; for help.

0>
}}}

Try a simple query:

{{{
select 'hello world';
}}}

It should respond with the following output and prompt:

{{{

============
hello world

        Rows Returned   : 1
        Fields Returned : 1
        Elapsed Time    : 0.006065 sec

0>
}}}

There shouldn't be any errors or warnings.

Congratulations!  If you made it to this point, the SQL Relay server is configured correctly.
