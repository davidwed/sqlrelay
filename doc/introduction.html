<span class="heading1">Introduction to SQL Relay</span><br><br>

<p>The original motivation for <b>SQL Relay</b> stemmed from the following 
challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>The API that Oracle provides along with it's database is obscure.</li>
<li>Oracle databases can take a relatively long time to log into, reducing the
snappyness of transient programs such as CGI's.</li>
<li>Transient programs need to be small and statically linked to be efficient.  
The Oracle libraries are large and one of them (libclntsh.so) is only 
available as a shared object library on Linux.</li>
<li>It would be nice to be able to run a pool of web-servers using heterogeneous
hardware and operating systems against an Oracle database, but not be limited 
to Oracle-supported platforms for the web-servers.</li>
<li>Web-based applications that display reports need to display different
segments of the same query's result set over multiple individual runs of a 
given program.  It would be nice to be able to cache that result set rather
than have to re-run the same query over and over, discarding most of it each
time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following solution addresses these challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>A set of connection daemons maintain multiple open connections to 
Oracle.</li>
<li>A listener daemon listens on a TCP port for client connections.</li>
<li>The connection daemons advertise themselves to the listener daemon when 
they are available.</li>
<li>A client establishes a session with the listener daemon using a 
lightweight, statically linked C++ API library which can be compiled for any 
OS, independently of the daemons.</li>
<li>The listener hands off the session to an available session daemon.</li>
<li>The connection daemon receives queries from the client over the network,
executes the queries and returning the result sets back over the network to the 
client.</li>
<li>The client may then operate on the result set using API calls or cache it
for use by another client.</li>
<li>The session framework allows transactional operations like commits and 
rollbacks to work without having to auto-commit each query.</li>
<li>A cache manager daemon maintains the query cache and removes stale result
sets.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>SQL Relay</b> aims at implementing that solution.</p>

<p>Though <b>SQL Relay</b> is a fairly solid piece of software, it can still
be enhanced.  Below are some planned enhancements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for more databases.</li>
<li>Encrypted transmissions.</li>
<li>Replication facilitation.</li>
<li>Server-side result set caching.</li>
<li>Ports for non-unix based platforms.</li>
</ul>
