<span class="heading1">Install Software Packages</span><br>

<p>Oracle 1rg requires some software packages that may not have been installed
on your system.  Run the following yum command to install them:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>yum install libaio libaio-devel</b>
</blockquote>

<span class="heading1">Configure the Kernel</span><br>

<p>Oracle 10g requires that you at least temporarily increase the values of
a couple of kernel parameters.  To temporarily increase these values, follow
these instructions (as root):</p>

<blockquote>
<b>echo 65536 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max<br>
echo 2097152 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/shmall<br>
echo 2147483648 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax<br>
echo 4096 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni<br>
echo "250 32000 100 128" &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sem</b>
</blockquote>

<span class="heading1">Install Oracle</span><br>

<p>Now, log in as the oracle user.</p>

<p>Since Oracle 11.1.0 uses a graphical installer, you need to be running X
Windows or point the DISPLAY environment variable to an X Windows session
running somewhere.</p>

<p>I have had problems with the graphical installer on enlightenment and
fluxbox window managers in the past, though they may work for you.</p>

<p>If you have a CD, mount it and cd to the mount point.  If you have a zip
distribution, extract the file using:<p>

<blockquote><b>
unzip linux_x86_11gR1_database.zip<br>
</b></blockquote>

Change directories to the database directory.<br><br>

Type <b>./runInstaller</b><br><br>

On the <b>Installation Method</b> screen, accept the default Basic Installation.  Change the Global Database Name from "orcl" to "ora1".  Enter a password in the Database Password and Confirm Password boxes for the SYS, SYSTEM, SYSMAN and DBSNMP accounts.  Be sure to enter a password that starts with a letter, not a number.  Click <b>Next</b><br><br>

The window will go away and a <b>Specify Inventory directory and credentials</b> dialog will appear.  In the <b>Enter the full path of the inventory directory</b> type in /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory.  Click <b>Next</b><br><br>

The window will go away and a <b>Product-Specific Prerequisite Checks</b> dialog will appear and operating system requirements will be checked.  When it's done,
click <b>Next</b>.

If a dialog pops up indicating that some of the prerequisite checks have failed,
click <b>Yes</b> to proceed.<br><br>

On the <b>Oracle Configuration Manager Registration</b> screen, just click <b>Next</b>.

On the <b>Summary</b> screen, click <b>Install</b><br><br>

The <b>Install</b> screen will show the progress of the installation<br><br>

When installation is finished, the <b>Configuration Assistants</b> screen will
show the progress of the initial configuration processes.<br><br>

A <b>Database Configuration Assistant</b> dialog should pop up.  The image on
the left hand side will change regularlry, but the dialog itself may not
display anything.  Ignore this, the configuration is occurring.<br><br>

When database creation is complete, a dialog will pop up with a summary.  Click
<b>OK</b>.<br><br>

Afterward, you may get a message indicating that the database configuration assistant failed.  This appears to be erroneous.  Click <b>Next</b> and <b>OK</b> on the dialog that pops up.<br><br>

<p>A dialog will pop up asking you to run some scripts as root.  Just follow the
directions on the dialog and click <b>Ok</b><br><br>

On the <b>End Of Installation</b> screen click <b>Exit</b><br><br>

A dialog will pop up asking: Do you really want to exit?
Click <b>Yes</b>.<br><br>

<span class="heading1">Post-Installation</span><br>

<p>During the installation, several ancillary processes were started.  You can
shut some of them down by executing the following commands (as oracle):</p>

<blockquote><b>
emctl stop dbconsole<br>
</b></blockquote>

<p>At this point, only the database and tns listener should be running.</p>

<p>During the installation, the tnsnames.ora file which tells clients how to
connect to the database will most likely have been created in 640 mode, leaving
it unreadable by anyone not in the oinstall group.  There are 2 options here,
either add every user that you want to be able to access oracle to the
oinstall group, or change permissions on tnsnames.ora to make it world-readable.
If you opt for the latter, you can do so using the following command:</p>

<blockquote><b>
chmod o+r /u01/app/oracle/product/11.1.0/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
</b></blockquote>
