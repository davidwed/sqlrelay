<p>Add the following line to /home/oracle/.bashrc near the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Some versions of Redhat 9 came with the following glibc RPM:</p>

<blockquote><b>glibc-2.3.2-5.i386.rpm</b></blockquote>

<p>Others came with:</p>

<blockquote><b>glibc-2.3.2-11.9.i386.rpm</b></blockquote>

<p>The first one works but the second one is broken.</p>

<p>If you have run up2date (or apt-get upgrade if you're using apt) then it
is likely that even if you once had a working glibc, you no longer do.<p>

<p>To assure that Oracle will install and run, download and install
<a href="http://www.firstworks.com/support/libctypefixup-1.0.tar.gz">libctypefixup</a> using the following commands (as root).</p>

<blockquote>
<b>tar xf libctypefixup-1.0.tar.gz<br>
cd libctypefixup-1.0<br>
make<br>
make install<br>
</b></blockquote>
