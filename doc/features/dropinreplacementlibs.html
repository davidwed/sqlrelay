<p>The SQL Relay Drop-In Replacement Libraries for MySQL and PostgreSQL are libraries that can be LD_PRELOAD'ed to take the place of the native MySQL and PostgreSQL client libraries.</p>

<p>They allow many applications that are written to use MySQL or PostgreSQL directly to use SQL Relay without modification.  This allows an app to immediately take advantage of SQL Relay features such as connection pooling, load balancing, query routing and throttling.  It is also useful for migrating an application from one database to another.</p>

<p>See <a href="dropin/mysql.html">SQL Relay Drop-In Replacement Library for MySQL</a> and <a href="dropin/postgresql.html">SQL Relay Drop-In Replacement Library for PostgreSQL</a> for more information.</p>
