<span class="heading1">Drop-In Replacement Libraries</span><br><br>

<p>The SQL Relay Drop-In Replacement Libraries are shared-object libraries that can be LD_PRELOAD'ed to take the place of the native MySQL or PostgreSQL client libraries.</p>

<p>An app that was written to use MySQL or PostgreSQL directly can immediately take advantage of SQL Relay features such as connection pooling, load balancing, query routing and throttling without modification.  It can also be used to aim an app that was written to use MySQL or PostgreSQL at a different database.</p>
