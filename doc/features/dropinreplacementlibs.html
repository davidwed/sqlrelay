<h1>Drop-In Replacement Libraries</h1>

<p>Solves - "I wrote my app using the native MySQL API but the company is migrating to Oracle. I can tweak the queries to work with Oracle but I really don't want to have to modify the app to use OCI."</p>

<p>The SQL Relay Drop-In Replacement Libraries are shared-object libraries that can be LD_PRELOAD'ed to take the place of the native MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL client libraries.</p>

<p>Many apps that were written to use MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL dynamically load a client library to talk to the database.</p>

<p>The SQL Relay Drop-In Replacement Libraries intercept the native client library calls, map them to the SQL Relay equivalents and aim the client at an SQL Relay server.</p>

This can be used to aim an app that was written to use MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL at a different database or just allow an app to continue to use the MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL database but take advantage of SQL Relay features such as connection pooling, load balancing, query routing and throttling without modification.
