<span class="heading1">Query Routing and Filtering</span><br><br>

<p>Query routing sends queries that match one pattern to one set of database servers and queries that match another pattern to another set of servers.  A comon use for query routing is to route DML and DDL queries to a master and distribute alll other queries over a pool of slaves.</p>

<p>Query filtering prevents queries that match a certian pattern from being run at all.  There are often certain queries that will bring the entire database to its knees.  A common use for query filtering is to identify those queries and prevent them from being run.</p>

<p>A complete descripton of query routing and filtering with example configuration files is given <a href="../router.html">here</a>.</p>
