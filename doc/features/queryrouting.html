<h1>Query Routing</h1>

<p>Solves - "My database is getting slammed. I could replicate it but then I'd have to rewrite my app to send DML to the master and somehow distribute selects over the slaves."</p>

<p>Query routing sends queries that match one pattern to one set of database servers and queries that match another pattern to another set of servers.  A comon use for query routing is to route DML and DDL queries to a master and distribute select queries over a pool of slaves.</p>
