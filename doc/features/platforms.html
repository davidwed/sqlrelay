<span class="heading1">Supported Platforms</span><br><br>

<p>All SQL Relay components should build and run on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, Haiku and SCO OpenServer 5.  x86 and x86_64 platforms are supported, as are non-x86 architectures such as ARM, Sparc, Mips, PPC and others.</p>

<p>The client-side software should build and run on uClibc/Linux-based systems and possibly on uClibc/non-Linux-based systems as well.</p>

<p>The command line clients and C, C++ and .NET API's should build and run natively on Windows.  The server and client components should all build and run under Cygwin on Windows though there are currently performance and compatibility issues under Cygwin.</p>
