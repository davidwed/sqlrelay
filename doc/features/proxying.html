<span class="heading1">Proxying</span><br><br>

<p>Proxying provides access to databases from unsupported platforms.</p>

<p>Oracle, for example, doesn't support OpenBSD but by using the SQL Relay server components on a supported platform and the SQL Relay client components on OpenBSD, the OpenBSD machine can access the Oracle database.</p>

<p>SQL Relay can be built and run on most unix-like systems, independent of architecture, thus SQL Relay can provide access to databases from a wide variety of platforms not supported by the database vendor.</p>
