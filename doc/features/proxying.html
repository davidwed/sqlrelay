<p>Proxying provides access to databases from unsupported platforms.</p>

<p>Oracle, for example, doesn't support FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD but by running the SQL Relay server components on a supported platform such as Linux and the SQL Relay client components on the BSD platform, the BSD machine can access the Oracle database.</p>

<p>The SQL Relay client components can be built and run on most unix-like systems, independent of architecture, thus SQL Relay can provide access to databases from a wide variety of platforms not supported by the database vendor.</p>
