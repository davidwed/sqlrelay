[=#platforms]
== Supported Platforms ==

SQL Relay packages are currently available for:

* RPM-based Linux (Fedora, !CentOS/RHEL, and !OpenSuSE)
* !FreeBSD
* !NetBSD
* Windows

[=#linux]
== Linux ==

SQL Relay packages are currently available for RPM-based Linux distributions like Fedora, !CentOS/RHEL, and !OpenSuSE Linux, for the x86_64 architecture.

Packages are not currenly available for dpkg-based Linux like Ubunutu and Debian Linux or for non-x86_64 architectures.  On these platforms SQL Relay must be built from [installing.html source].

To download the Linux packages, download the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlrelay/files/sqlrelay/@SQLR_VERSION@/sqlrelay-binary-distribution-@SQLR_VERSION@.tar.gz/download SQL Relay Binary Distribution for Linux].  This file is a tar.gz containing RPMs for all supported Linux platforms.

To install packages, first extract the file:

{{{#!blockquote
{{{
tar xfz sqlrelay-binary-distribution-@SQLR_VERSION@.tar.gz
}}}
}}}

Then change directories into the directory that was created during the extraction:

{{{#!blockquote
{{{
cd sqlrelay-binary-distribution-@SQLR_VERSION@
}}}
}}}

Then change directories into the directory for the appropriate distribution, for example:

{{{#!blockquote
{{{
cd centos7x64
}}}
}}}

Then, install the RPMs.  Since different platforms use different packaging systems, installation instructions depend on the platform.

{{{#!blockquote

On Fedora platforms, run (as root):

{{{#!blockquote
{{{
dnf localinstall *
}}}
}}}

On !CentOS platforms, run (as root):

{{{#!blockquote
{{{
yum localinstall *
}}}
}}}

On !OpenSuSE platforms, run (as root):

{{{#!blockquote
{{{
zypper install *
}}}
}}}

}}}

In any case, the package packaging system should install the RPMs as well as any dependencies that they require.

Client libraries for most of the databases supported by SQL Relay are available as RPMs and should be automatically installed by the packaging system.  However, packages for commercial databases are not available from any standard package repository and must be installed manually for SQL Relay to actually work with these databases.

For SQL Relay to work with a commercial database, you must install and configure client libraries for one or more of [http://www.oracle.com Oracle], [http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/oltp-db SAP/Sybase], [http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/ DB2], or [http://www.ibm.com/software/data/informix/ Informix].
