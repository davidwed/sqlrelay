<span class="heading2">Configuration File Location</span><br>

<p>When SQL Relay is first installed, no configuration file exists.  You must create it in the appropriate location.</p>

<p>This location depends on the platform and on how you installed SQL Relay.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unix and Linux</li>
<ul>
<li>Built from source - <b>/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
<ul>
<li>(however, if you specified a --prefix or --sysconfdir during the build, then it might be in a different location)</li>
</ul>
<li>RPM package - <b>/etc/sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
<li>FreeBSD package - <b>/usr/local/etc/sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
<li>NetBSD package - <b>/usr/pkg/etc/sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
<li>OpenBSD package - <b>/usr/local/etc/sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
</ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<ul>
<li>Built from source - <b>C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
<li>Windows Installer package - <b>C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\sqlrelay.conf</b></li>
<ul>
<li>(however, if you specified a different folder during installatoin, then it might be in a different location)
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


<br><br><a name="minimal"></a>
<span class="heading2">Minimal Configuration</span><br>

<p>The most minimal SQL Relay configuration would be something like:</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-minimal.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>This configuration defines an instance of SQL Relay named <i>example</i>, secured by a user and password, that opens and maintains 5 persistent connections to the <i>orcl</i> instance of an Oracle database using <i>scott</i>/<i>tiger</i> credentials.</p>

<p>The instance can be started using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlr-start -id example
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, SQL Relay listens on all available network interfaces, on port 9000.  It can be accessed remotely by hostname.  For example, if the server running SQL Relay is named <i>sqlrserver</i> then it can be accessed using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlrsh -host <i>sqlrserver</i> -user sqlruser -password sqlrpassword
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>It can also be accessed from the local server using <i>localhost</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlrsh -host localhost -user sqlruser -password sqlrpassword
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>(<b>NOTE:</b> For versions of SQL Relay prior to 0.56, additional parameters were required for a minimal configuration.  In particular, either the port or socket parameter was required in the instance tag, the dbtype parameter was required in the instance tag, and connectionid and metric parameters were required in the connection tag.  See below, or see the <a href="configreference.html">Configuration Reference</a> for information about these parameters.)</p>


<br><br><a name="connections"></a>
<span class="heading2">Database Connections</span><br>

<p>By default, SQL Relay opens and maintains 5 persistent database connections, but the number of connections can be configured using the connections parameter.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-connections.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>The number of connections determines how many client applications can access the database simultaneously .  In this case, up to 10, assuming each client only needs one connection.  Additional clients can connect but get queued up and have to wait for one of the first 10 to disconnect before being able to access the database.</p>

<p>Any number of connections can be opened.  A good rule of thumb is to open as many as you can.  The optimal number is application specific though and is limited by database, system and network resources.</p>


<br><br><a name="cursors"></a>
<span class="heading2">Database Cursors</span><br>

<p>Database cursors are used to execute queries and step through result sets.  Most applications only need to use one cursor at a time.  Some apps require more though, either because they run nested queries, or sometimes because they just don't properly free them.</p>

<p>SQL Relay maintains persistent cursors as well as connections.  By default, each connection opens one cursor, but the number of cursors opened by each connection can be configured using the cursors parameter.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-cursors.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>Any number of cursors can be opened.  A good rule of thumb is to open as few as possible but as many as you know that your application will need.</p>


<br><br><a name="dynamicscaling"></a>
<span class="heading2">Dynamic Scaling</span><br>

<p>Both connections and cursors can be configured to scale dynamically - open on demand and then die off when no longer needed.  This feature is useful if you have spikes in traffic during certain times of day or if your application has a few modules that occasionally need more cursors than usual.</p>

<p>The maxconnections and maxcursors parameters define the upper bounds.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-dynamicscaling.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, 10 connections will be started initially but more will be be started as necessary, up to 20.  Each of the newly spawned connections will die off if they are inactive for longer than 1 minute.</p>

<p>In this example, each connection will initially open 2 cursors but more will be opened as necessary, up to 10.  Each newly opened cursor will be closed as soon as it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>Other parameters that control dynamic scaling behavior include:</p>

<ul>
<li>maxqueuelength</li>
<li>growby</li>
<li>ttl</li>
<li>cursors_growby</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="configreference.html">SQL Relay Configuration Reference</a> for more information on these parameters.</p>


<br><br><a name="listener"></a>
<span class="heading2">Listener Configuration</span><br>

<p>By default, SQL Relay listens for client connections on port 9000, on all available network interfaces.</p>

<p>It can be configured to listen on a different port though...</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-port.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>...and accessed using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlrsh -host <i>sqlrserver</i> -port 9001 -user sqlruser -password sqlrpassword
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>It can also be configured to listen on a unix socket...</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-socket.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>...and accessed from the local server using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlrsh -socket /tmp/example.socket -user sqlruser -password sqlrpassword
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>If the server has multiple network interfaces, SQL Relay can also be configured to listen on specific IP addresses.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-addresses.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>When configured this way, it can be accessed on 192.168.1.50 and 192.168.1.51 but not on 127.0.0.1 (localhost).</p>

<p>If the socket option is specified but port and addresses options are not, then SQL Relay will only listen on the socket.  If addresses/port and socket options are both specified then it listens on both.</p>


<br><br><a name="database"></a>
<span class="heading2">Database Configuration</span><br>

<p>By default, SQL Relay assumes that it's connecting to an Oracle database, but SQL Relay supports many other databases.  The dbase parameter can be used to specify the database type.</p>

<p>In the following example, SQL Relay is configured to connect to a SAP/Sybase database.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-sap.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, SQL Relay is configured to connect to an IBM DB2 database.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-db2.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>When connecting to an Oracle database, the dbase parameter may be omitted or set to "oracle".</p>

<p>SQL Relay supports many different databases and the connect string options (options in the string attribute of the connection tag) are different for each database.  See the <a href="configreference.html">SQL Relay Configuration Reference</a> for valid dbase settings and information on connect string options for each database.</p>


<br><br><a name="cluster"></a>
<span class="heading2">Replicated or Clustered Databases</span><br>

<p>SQL Relay can be configured to distribute connections over the nodes of a database cluster or pool of replicated servers.  Each connection tag defines a  node to connect to.</p>

<p>In this example, SQL Relay is configured to distribute over two instances of Oracle - orcl1 and orcl2</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-replicated.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>Any number of connection tags may be defined.</p>

<p>The metric parameter is especially important if the nodes are heterogenous (ie. if some nodes are more powerful than others).  SQL Relay uses it to decide how many connections to open to each node.  It doesn't specify the number of connections to open to each node, but the higher the metric relative to the other metrics, the more connections to that node will be started.  For example, if the metric for the first node is twice as large as the metric for the second node, then SQL Relay will open twice as many connections to the first node as the second.</p>

<p>In this example, 15 is 1.5 times 10, so 1.5 as many connections will be started to orcl2 as to orcl1.  Since a total of 10 connections will be started, 4 will be started to orcl1 and 6 to orcl2.</p>

<p>A similar configuration could be used to distribute connections over the nodes of a cluster.</p>

<p>When the nodes are located behind a load balancer or share a common IP address, only one connection tag should be used, with the behindloadbalancer attribute.</p>

<p>In this example, SQL Relay is configured to distribute over an Oracle RAC.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-rac.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>See the <a href="configreference.html">SQL Relay Configuration Reference</a> for more information on this parameter.</p>


<br><br><a name="router"></a>
<span class="heading2">Master-Slave Query Routing</span><br>

<p>In a master-slave replication scenario, SQL Relay can be configured to route DML and DDL queries to the master and distribute selects over the slaves.</p>

<p>This actually requires 3 instances of SQL Relay.  One to connect to the master, one to connect to the slaves, and a third to route queries to the first two.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-router.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>The first two instances use familiar configuration options, but the third uses a dbtype of "router" and rather than defining connections, uses router, route and query tags to define query routing rules.</p>

<p>The router tag defines a set of routes.  The attributes of each route tag specify an instance of SQL Relay to connect to.  The pattern attribute of each query tag defines a regular expression used to match queries.  Queries that match the set of patterns defined in the route tag are sent to the instance of SQL Relay designated in the route tag.</p>

<p>The three instances can be started using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlr-start -id master<br>
sqlr-start -id slave<br>
sqlr-start -id router
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Client applications should connect to the router instance rather than the master or slave instances.</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlrsh -host <i>sqlrserver</i> -user routeruser -password routerpassword
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>See the <a href="router.html">Query Routing</a> for more information on query routing.</p>


<br><br><a name="sessionqueries"></a>
<span class="heading2">Session-Queries</span><br>

<p>SQL Relay can be configured to run a set of queries at the beginning and end of each client session.</p>

<p>By far the most common use for this feature is that some database parameter needs to be reconfigured but you don't have permission or bouncing the database is out of the question, or something like that.  For example, lets say you are using an Oracle database, but your app requires dates to be formatted like MM/DD/YYYY instead of DD-MON-YYYY.  Ideally you'd alter the nls_date_format in the instance but you can't, for some reason.</p>

<p>You can use SQL Relay's session queries to work around the problem.</p>

<p>In this example, the date format is set to MM/DD/YYYY at the beginning of the session and then reset back to DD-MON-YYYY at the end.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-sessionqueries.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, in this example, there's no need to set the date format back to DD-MON-YYYY but it's done here for illustrative purposes.</p>


<br><br><a name="instances"></a>
<span class="heading2">Multiple Instances</span><br>

<p>Any number of SQL Relay instances can be defined in the configuration file.</p>

<p>In following example, instances that connect to Oracle, SAP/Sybase and DB2 are defined in the same file.</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-multiple.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>These instances can be started using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample<br>
sqlr-start -id sapexample<br>
sqlr-start -id db2example
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>...and accessed using:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlrsh -host <i>sqlrserver</i> -port 9000<br>
sqlrsh -host <i>sqlrserver</i> -port 9001<br>
sqlrsh -host <i>sqlrserver</i> -port 9002<br>
</code>
</blockquote>


<br><br><a name="directory"></a>
<span class="heading2">Configuration Directory</span><br>

<p>While any number of SQL Relay instances can be defined in a single configuration file, it might be more convenient to split configurations up into multiple files.</p>

<p>The default the SQL Relay configuration directory depends on the platform and on how you installed SQL Relay.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unix and Linux</li>
<ul>
<li>Built from source - <b>/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
<ul>
<li>(however, if you specified a --prefix or --sysconfdir during the build, then it might be in a different location)</li>
</ul>
<li>RPM package - <b>/etc/sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
<li>FreeBSD package - <b>/usr/local/etc/sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
<li>NetBSD package - <b>/usr/pkg/etc/sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
<li>OpenBSD package - <b>/usr/local/etc/sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
</ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<ul>
<li>Built from source - <b>C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
<li>Windows Installer package - <b>C:\Program Files\Firstworks\etc\sqlrelay.conf.d</b></li>
<ul>
<li>(however, if you specified a different folder during installatoin, then it might be in a different location)
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Additional configuration files may be created under this directory.  These files must follow the same format as the main configuration file.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to split up oracle, sap and db2 configurations into 3 separate files, you could create:</p>

<p><b>.../sqlrelay.conf.d/oracle.conf</b></p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-multipleoracle.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p><b>.../sqlrelay.conf.d/sap.conf</b></p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-multiplesap.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p><b>.../sqlrelay.conf.d/db2.conf</b></p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-multipledb2.conf.html@
</blockquote>


<br><br><a name="specifying"></a>
<span class="heading2">Specifying Configuration Files</span><br>

<p>In addition to the -id option, the sqlr-start program also takes a -config option.  The -config option can be used to specify a configuration file or directory other than the default.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config /home/myuser/mysqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config file:///home/myuser/mysqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config dir:///home/myuser/mysqlrelay.conf.d<br/>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>(the file:// prefix is optional when specifying a file, but the dir:// prefix must be included when specifying a directory)</p>

<p>The -config option may also be used to specify a comma-separated list of files or directories.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config /home/myuser/mysqlrelay-1.conf,/home/myuser/mysqlrelay-2.conf</br>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config /home/myuser/mysqlrelay-1.conf,/home/myuser/mysqlrelay-2.conf,dir:///home/myuser/mysqrelay.conf.d</br>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config /home/myuser/mysqlrelay-1.conf,/home/myuser/mysqlrelay-2.conf,dir:///home/myuser/mysqrelay-1.conf.d,dir:///home/myuser/mysqrelay-2.conf.d</br>
</blockquote>

<p>Files and directories are processed in the order that they are specified.</p>


<br><br><a name="remote"></a>
<span class="heading2">Remote Configuration Files</span><br>

<p>In addition to local configuration files, the -config option may also be used to specify configuration files located on a remote host, accessible via http.</p>

<p>Actually, if the Rudiments library upon which SQL Relay depends was compiled with support for libcurl, then configuration files may also be remotely accessible over other protocols supported by libcurl, such as https, ftp, scp, sftp, smb, etc.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config http://configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config http://[/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlruserpwd.txt]@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf<br/><br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config https://configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config https://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config https://[/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlruserpwd.txt]@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf<br/><br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config scp://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlrelay.conf<br/>
sqlr-start -id oracleexample -config scp://[/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlruserpwd.txt]@configserver.mydomain.com/usr/local/firstworks/etc/sqlrelay.conf<br/>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note: the https and scp examples would only work if Rudiments is compiled with support for libcurl.)</p>

<p>In some of the examples above, a user and password are given in the url, separated by a colon, prior to the @ sign.  In other examples, in place of a literal user and password, a user-password file is specified in square brackets.  If a user-password file is used, then the file should contain a single line, consisting of colon-separated user and password.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>myuser:mypassword</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Password protection is recommended for remotely accessible configuration files as they may contain users and passwords for accessing the database and SQL Relay itself.</p>

<p>Using user-password files is recommended over passing literal users and passwords.  The files can be protected with file permissions, they prevent the user and password from being stored in the script that starts SQL Relay, and they prevent the user and password from being displayed in a process listing.</p>


<br><br><a name="linkfiles"></a>
<span class="heading2">Link Files</span><br>

<p>So far, the example configuration files have all been XML files, containing configurations for instances of SQL Relay.</p>

<p>However, a configuration file can, alternatively, be a "link file", containing nothing but links to other configuration files.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
<font color="#0000ff"># oracle configuration</font><br/>
<font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/oracle.conf</font><br/>
<br/>
<font color="#0000ff"># sap/sybase configuration</font><br/>
<font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sap.conf</font><br/>
<br/>
<font color="#0000ff"># db2 configuration</font><br/>
<font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/db2.conf</font><br/>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Lines starting with # are considered to be comments and blank lines are ignored, but every other line is interpreted as the location of a local configuration file, local configuration directory, or remote configuration file, as described in the previous sections.</p>

<p>Each of these files or directories are processed in the order that they are specified.</p>

<p>Link files can be used to centralize configuration.  For example, if you have several SQL Relay servers, rather than distributing configuration files across the servers, you could create an identical sqlrelay.conf file on each of them like:</p>

<blockquote>
<code><font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sqlrelay.conf</font></code>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, on configserver.mydomain.com, host an sqlrelay.conf file like:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
<font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/oracle.conf</font><br/>
<font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/sap.conf</font><br/>
<font color="#008b8b">http://myuser:mypassword@configserver.mydomain.com/sqlrconfig/db2.conf</font><br/>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>The files oracle.conf, sap.conf, and db2.conf could then be hosted by and maintained on that server as well.</p>

<p>The links in these examples are all urls, but they could just as easily be links to local files and directories as well.  It is important to note though, that SQL Relay interprets all local file and directory locations relative to the local machine.  If a remotely hosted link file contains a reference to a local file or directory, then SQL Relay will look for that file on the local machine, not the remote machine.</p>

<p>Similarly, urls are resolved using the DNS configuration of the local machine as well, not the DNS configuration of the remote machine.</p>

<p>The urls in these examples all contain literal users and passwords.  User-password files can also be used as described in the section <a href="#remote">Remote Configuration Files</a>.  However, the user-password file must exist at the specified location on the local machine.</p>

<p>As link files can be protected by file permissions, and the urls stored in them aren't exposed anywhere else, such as in a process listing, user-password files are not generally necessary when using link files.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the depth of links.  A link file can reference another link file which references another, which references another, etc.  Too great a depth could lead to slow startup times though, especially when using remote configration files. This is especially significant when using <a href="#dynamicscaling">Dynamic Scaling</a>, as the configuration must be loaded each time a new connection is spawned.  Care should also be taken to avoid loops.</p>


<br><br><a name="autostart"></a>
<span class="heading2">Starting Instances Automatically</span><br>

<p>In all previous examples sqlr-start has been called with the -id option, specifying which instance to start.  If sqlr-start is called without the -id option then it will start all intances configured with the enabled attribute set to yes.</p>

<p>For example, if the following instances are defined...</p>

<blockquote>
@sqlrelay-autostart.conf.html@
</blockquote>

<p>...then calling sqlr-start without the -id parameter will start oracleexample and sapexample because enabled="yes" is configured for those instances.  db2example will not be started because enabled="yes" is not configured for that instance.</p>

<p>When installed on most platforms, SQL Relay creates an init script in the appropriate place under /etc.  This init script calls sqlr-start with no -id option.  If configured to run at boot, it will start all instances for which enabled="yes" is configured.</p>

<p>How to enable the init script depends on what platform you are using.</p>

<p>On Linux, Solaris, SCO and other non-BSD Unixes, this usually involves creating a symlink from /etc/init.d/sqlrelay to /etc/rc3.d/S85sqlrelay.</p>

<p>Redhat-derived Linux distributions have a chkconfig command that can do this for you.  Debian-derived Linux distributions provide the update-rc.d command.  Older versions of Solaris provide svcadm.  Newer versions of Solaris provide smf.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD you must add a line to /etc/rc.conf like:</p>

<blockquote>
sqlrelay_enabled=YES
</blockquote>

<p>On NetBSD you must add a line to /etc/rc.conf like:</p>

<blockquote>
sqlrelay=YES
</blockquote>

<p>On OpenBSD you must add a line to /etc/rc.conf like:</p>

<blockquote>
sqlrelay_flags=""
</blockquote>

<p>The configuration file supports many more attributes and features than the ones described in this guide including tuning options and extension modules.
