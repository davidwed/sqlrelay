<span class="heading2">Platforms</span>

<p>SQL Relay is supported on a variety of Linux/Unix systems and Windows.  Building SQL Relay on any of these platforms requires the installation of a compiler toolchain and other bits of optional software.  Instructions follow for many supported platforms.</p>

<p>SQL Relay is supported on a variety of Linux platforms including Fedora, CentOS, OpenSuSE, Debian, and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>To install all prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<p class="code">dnf -y install gcc-c++ make readline-devel perl-devel php-devel php-pdo python-devel ruby-devel ruby-libs ruby tcl-devel java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel erlang nodejs-devel node-gyp mono-devel mono-data-oracle mariadb-devel postgresql-devel firebird-devel firebird-libfbclient sqlite-devel unixODBC-devel freetds-devel mdbtools-devel mdbtools-libs</p>

<p>The gcc-c++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PHP support, then you can omit the php-devel and php-pdo packages.</p>

<p>Note that on older Fedora platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>The yum package manager is used instead of the dnf package manager.  The syntax for the two is the same though, just replace dnf with yum in the command above.</li>
<li>JDK 1.8.0 is not available, so java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel must be replaced with an older version.</li>
<li>MariaDB is not available, so mariadb-devel must be replaced with mysql-devel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Packages for for Oracle, SAP/Sybase, DB2, and Informix client API's are not available from dnf/yum repositories and must be installed separately.</p>

<p>The simplest way to install the Oracle client API is to download the Oracle Instant Client RPM's from <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> and install them using the following commands, as root:</p>

<p class="code">dnf install libaio<br/>
rpm -i oracle-instantclient12.1-basic oracle-instantclient12.1-devel</p>

<p>For SAP/Sybase, you have to download the ASE installer from <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a> and install the client components.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/p/getting.html">Getting Started with SAP/Sybase</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For DB2, you have to download the installer from <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> and perform a full installation.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/p/getting-started-with-ibm-db2.html">Getting Started with IBM DB2</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For Informix, you also have to download the installer from <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> and perform a full installation, though it isn't necessary to create a local instance.</p>

<p>To install all prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<p>The gcc-c++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PHP support, then you can omit the php-devel and php-pdo packages.</p>

<p>Note that on older CentOS platforms, MariaDB is not available, so mariadb-devel must be replaced with mysql-devel.</p>

<p>Packages are not available for Erlang, node.js, Mono, Firebird, FreeTDS, or MDB Tools.  If support is required for these languages or databases, then they must be built and installed from source.</p>

<p>Packages for for Oracle, SAP/Sybase, DB2, and Informix client API's are not available from yum repositories and must be installed separately.</p>

<p>The simplest way to install the Oracle client API is to download the Oracle Instant Client RPM's from <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> and install them using the following commands, as root:</p>
