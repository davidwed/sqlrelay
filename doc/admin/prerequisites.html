<p>SQL Relay is supported on a variety of Linux/Unix systems and Windows.  Building SQL Relay on these platforms requires the installation of a compiler toolchain and other bits of optional software.  Instructions follow for many supported platforms.</p>

<p>SQL Relay is supported on a variety of Linux platforms including Fedora, CentOS, OpenSuSE, Debian, and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>To install all prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<p class="code">dnf -y install gcc-c++ make readline-devel perl-devel php-devel php-pdo python-devel ruby-devel ruby-libs ruby tcl-devel java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel erlang nodejs-devel node-gyp mono-devel mono-data-oracle mariadb-devel postgresql-devel firebird-devel firebird-libfbclient sqlite-devel unixODBC-devel freetds-devel mdbtools-devel mdbtools-libs</p>

<p>The gcc-c++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PHP support, then you can omit the php-devel and php-pdo packages.</p>

<p>Note that on older Fedora platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>The yum package manager is used instead of the dnf package manager.  The syntax for the two is the same though, just replace dnf with yum in the command above.</li>
<li>JDK 1.8.0 is not available, so java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel must be replaced with an older version.</li>
<li>MariaDB is not available, so mariadb-devel must be replaced with mysql-devel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Packages for for Oracle, SAP/Sybase, DB2, and Informix client API's are not available from dnf/yum repositories and must be installed separately.</p>

<p>The simplest way to install the Oracle client API is to download the Oracle Instant Client RPM's from <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> and install them using the following commands, as root:</p>

<p class="code">dnf install libaio<br/>
rpm -i oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-* oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-*</p>

<p>For SAP/Sybase, you have to download the ASE installer from <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a> and install the client components.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/p/getting.html">Getting Started with SAP/Sybase</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For DB2, you have to download the installer from <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> and perform a full installation.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/p/getting-started-with-ibm-db2.html">Getting Started with IBM DB2</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For Informix, you also have to download the installer from <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> and perform a full installation, though it isn't necessary to create a local instance.</p>

<p>The gcc-c++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PHP support, then you can omit the php-devel and php-pdo packages.</p>

<p>Note that on older CentOS platforms, MariaDB is not available, so mariadb-devel must be replaced with mysql-devel.</p>

<p>Packages are not available for Erlang, node.js, Mono, Firebird, FreeTDS, or MDB Tools.  If support is required for these languages or databases, then they must be built and installed from source.</p>

<a name="windows"></a>
<span class="heading3">Windows</span>

<blockquote>

<p>SQL Relay is supported on a variety of Windows platforms.  Building SQL Relay on these platforms requires the installation of a compiler toolchain and other bits of optional software.</p>

<p>SQL Relay can be built using the Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Express toolchains.  Visual Studio Express can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Microsoft</a> and the installer is intuitive.</p>

<p>Perl, Python, and TCL packages for Windows are available from <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a>.  All three are available for free and come with intuitive installers.  The Python and TCL packages are complete.  Some Active Perl packages lack the .lib file required for building Perl modules though and it must be built manually.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/2016/01/generating-missing-import-file-from-dll.html"> Generating a Missing Import File From a DLL </a> for instructions.</p>

<p>PHP packages for Windows are available from the <a href="http://windows.php.net/download">PHP</a> project.  The installer is intuitive but the packages lack headers necessary to build PHP modules and they must be generated manually.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/2016/01/shoehorning-development-headers-into.html">Shoehorning Development Headers Into PHP for Windows</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>Ruby packages for Windows are available but lack so many of the components necessary to build Ruby modules, that it is simpler to just build it from source.  See <a href="http://systems.firstworks.com/2016/01/building-ruby-220-with-microsoft-visual.html"> Building Ruby 2.2.0 with Microsoft Visual Studio</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>Java packages for Windows are available from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle</a>.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are is complete.</p>

<p>node.js packages for Windows are available from the <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> project.  The installer is intuitive but the packages lack development files necessary to build node.js modules and they must be installed separately.  See <a href="">this article</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>Support for C# and other .NET languages is provided by Visual Studio.  No additional software needs to be installed to build SQL Relay's C# or ADO.NET modules.</p>

<p>MySQL packages for Windows are available from the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/">MySQL</a> project.  The Connector/C package is the only package that is necessary to install to build SQL Relay with support for MySQL.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are complete.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL packages for Windows are available from the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/">PostgreSQL</a> project.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are complete.</p>

<p>Firebird packages for Windows are available from the <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/downloads/">Firebird</a> project.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are complete.</p>

<p>Oracle packages for Windows are available from <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a>.  The Instant Client package is the only package that is necessary to install to build SQL Relay with support for Oracle.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are complete.</p>

<p>SAP/Sybase packages for Windows are available from <a href="http://www.sap.com">SAP</a>.  The ASE installer is intuitive.  You only have to install the client components.</p>

<p>DB2 packages for Windows are available from <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are complete.  You will have to perform a full installation though.</p>

<p>Informix packages for Windows are available from <a href="http://www.informix.com">IBM</a>.  The installer is intuitive and the packages are complete.  You will have to perform a full installation, though it isn't necessary to create a local instance.</p>

<p>Support for ODBC is provided by Visual Studio and Windows itself.  No additional software needs to be installed to build SQL Relay's ODBC modules.</p>

<p>On Linux and Unix platforms, SQL Relay uses FreeTDS is generally used to access Microsoft SQL Server but on Windows, ODBC is used instead.  The ODBC driver for SQL Server must be installed to connect to a SQL Server database, but no additional software needs to be installed to build SQL Relay.</p>
