# Enables Kerberos authentication and encryption.
#
# "service" indicates the Kerberos service name of the
# SQL Relay server.  If left empty or NULL then the service
# name "sqlrelay" will be used. "sqlrelay" is the default
# service name of the SQL Relay server.  Note that on Windows
# platforms the service name must be fully qualified,
# including the host and realm name.  For example:
# "sqlrelay/sqlrserver.firstworks.com@AD.FIRSTWORKS.COM".
#
# "mech" indicates the specific Kerberos mechanism to use.
# On Linux/Unix platforms, this should be a string
# representation of the mechnaism's OID, such as:
#     { 1 2 840 113554 1 2 2 }
# On Windows platforms, this should be a string like:
#     Kerberos
# If left empty or NULL then the default mechanism will be
# used.  Only set this if you know that you have a good
# reason to.
#
# "flags" indicates what Kerberos flags to use.  Multiple
# flags may be specified, separated by commas.  If left
# empty or NULL then a defalt set of flags will be used.
# Only set this if you know that you have a good reason to.
#
# Valid flags include:
#  * GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG
#  * GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG
#  * GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG
#  * GSS_C_CONF_FLAG
#  * GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG
#
# For a full list of flags, consult the GSSAPI documentation,
# though note that only the flags listed above are supported
# on Windows. */
proc enableKerberos {service mech flags}

# Enables TLS/SSL encryption, and optionally authentication.
#
# "version" specifies the TLS/SSL protocol version that the
# client will attempt to use.  Valid values include SSL2,
# SSL3, TLS1, TLS1.1, TLS1.2 or any more recent version of
# TLS, as supported by and enabled in the underlying TLS/SSL
# library.  If left blank or empty then the highest supported
# version will be negotiated.
#
# "cert" is the file name of the certificate chain file to
# send to the SQL Relay server.  This is only necessary if
# the SQL Relay server is configured to authenticate and
# authorize clients by certificate.
#
# If "cert" contains a password-protected private key, then
# "password" may be supplied to access it.  If the private
# key is not password-protected, then this argument is
# ignored, and may be left empty or NULL.
#
# "ciphers" is a list of ciphers to allow.  Ciphers may be
# separated by spaces, commas, or colons.  If "ciphers" is
# empty or NULL then a default set is used.  Only set this if
# you know that you have a good reason to.
#
# For a list of valid ciphers on Linux/Unix platforms, see:
#     man ciphers
#
# For a list of valid ciphers on Windows platforms, see:
#     https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa375549%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
# On Windows platforms, the ciphers (alg_id's) should omit
# CALG_ and may be given with underscores or dashes.
# For example: 3DES_112
#
# "validate" indicates whether to validate the SQL Relay's
# server certificate, and may be set to one of the following:
#     "no" - Don't validate the server's certificate.
#     "ca" - Validate that the server's certificate was
#            signed by a trusted certificate authority.
#     "ca+host" - Perform "ca" validation and also validate
#            that one of the subject altenate names (or the
#            common name if no SANs are present) in the
#            certificate matches the host parameter.
#            (Falls back to "ca" validation when a unix
#            socket is used.)
#     "ca+domain" - Perform "ca" validation and also validate
#            that the domain name of one of the subject
#            alternate names (or the common name if no SANs
#            are present) in the certificate matches the
#            domain name of the host parameter.  (Falls back
#            to "ca" validation when a unix socket is used.)
#
# "ca" is the location of a certificate authority file to
# use, in addition to the system's root certificates, when
# validating the SQL Relay server's certificate.  This is
# useful if the SQL Relay server's certificate is self-signed.
#
# On Windows, "ca" must be a file name.
#
# On non-Windows systems, "ca" can be either a file or
# directory name.  If it is a directory name, then all
# certificate authority files found in that directory will be
# used.  If it a file name, then only that file will be used.
#
#
# Note that the supported "cert" and "ca" file formats may
# vary between platforms.  A variety of file formats are
# generally supported on Linux/Unix platfoms (.pem, .pfx,
# etc.) but only the .pfx format is currently supported on
# Windows. */
