BASIC INSTALL:

	To compile sqlrelay type:

		configure
		make

	To install sqlrelay become superuser and type:

		make install

	Libraries are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/lib
	Includes are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/include
	Binaries and scripts are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/bin

	To uninstall sqlrelay become superuser and type:

		make uninstall



CUSTOM INSTALL:

	Some defaults settings can be modified by editing the file defaults.h
	The file contains descriptions of each modifyable parameter.

	The default installation prefix is /usr/local/firstworks.
	The libraries are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/lib,
	the header files in /usr/local/firstworks/include and
	the binaries and scripts are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/bin.

	The /usr/local/firstworks part of these paths may be changed to any 
	other directory by invoking configure with the --prefix option.

		For example:
			configure --prefix=/usr/local

	This invocation would cause the libraries to be installed in
	/usr/local/lib, the header files in /usr/local/include and
	the binaries and scripts to be installed in /usr/local/bin.



	To compile sqlrelay, first type:

		configure

	This will generate a file called config.mk containing some
	compile time options.  Edit this file to your liking.  If you
	run configure again, you will have to edit the file again.

	Then type:

		make

	To install sqlrelay become superuser and type:

		make install

	To uninstall sqlrelay become superuser and type:

		make uninstall


RPM INSTALL:

	If your system supports RedHat Package Manager RPM version 4.0.3 or
	greater then you can build RPMS by running the following command
	against the distribution tarball:

		rpm -ta sqlrelay-xxx.tar.gz

	(where xxx is replaced with the version number)

	You can instruct the build process not to build certain modules by
	giving it one of the following flags:

		-without db2
		-without freetds
		-without interbase
		-without lago
		-without msql
		-without mysql
		-without odbc
		-without oracle
		-without postgresql
		-without sqlite
		-without sybase
		-without perl
		-without python
		-without php
		-without java
		-without zope

	For example, if you want to build everything but the oracle and zope
	modules, then you would run the following command:

		rpm -ta -without oracle -without zope sqlrelay-xxx.tar.gz

	(where xxx is replaced with the version number)

	This will generate RPM's in the system-wide RPM directory (usually
	/usr/src/redhat/RPMS or /usr/local/rpm/RPMS) under the subdirectory
	corresponding to your system architecture.  You can install them by
	changing directories into that directory and executing the following
	command as root:

		rpm -i sqlrelay-*
