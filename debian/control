Package: sqlrelay
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ class library for developing systems and applications
 SQL Relay is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying, throttling,
 load balancing and query routing/filtering system for Unix and Linux
 supporting ODBC, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SAP/Sybase, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2,
 Informix, Firebird, SQLite and MS Access (minimally) with APIs for C, C++,
 .NET, Perl, Perl-DBI, Python, Python-DB, PHP, PHP PDO, Ruby, Java, TCL,
 Erlang, and node.js, ODBC and ADO.NET drivers, drop-in replacement libraries
 for MySQL and PostgreSQL, command line clients and extensive documentation.
 The APIs support advanced database operations such as bind variables,
 multi-row fetches, client-side result set caching and suspended transactions.
 It is ideal for speeding up database-driven web-based applications, accessing
 databases from unsupported platforms, migrating between databases, distributing
 access to replicated or clustered databases and throttling database access.
