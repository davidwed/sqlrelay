BASIC INSTALL:

	To compile SQL Relay, make sure your ORACLE_HOME environment variable is
	set if you want to include support for Oracle and type:

		configure
		make

	The configure script takes lots of command line options, most of which
	tell it where to find prerequisite software in case any of it is
	installed in non-standard locations.  It also takes the --prefix option
	in case you want to install SQL Relay somewhere other than
	/usr/local/firstworks.  You can run "configure --help" to get a list of
	command line options.  For example:

		configure --prefix=/usr/local

	This invocation would cause the libraries to be installed in
	/usr/local/lib, the header files in /usr/local/include, the binaries
	and scripts to be installed in /usr/local/bin, etc.

	To install SQL Relay become superuser and type:

		make install

	Libraries are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/lib.  Include files
	are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/include.  Binaries and scripts
	are installed in /usr/local/firstworks/bin.  An example config file is
	installed in /usr/local/firstworks/etc.  Java libraries are installed
	in /usr/local/firstworks/java.  Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby and TCL files
	are installed in the appropriate language-specific directories.
	
	If you install SQL Relay as root, init scripts and files will be
	installed in the appropriate places under /etc for your system.  If you
	install SQL Relay as a non-root user, the init scripts and files will
	be installed in similar places under /usr/local/firstworks/etc.

	To uninstall SQL Relay become superuser and type:

		make uninstall

RPM INSTALL:

	If your system supports RedHat Package Manager RPM version 4.0.3 or
	greater then you can build RPMS by running the following command
	against the distribution tarball:

		rpm -ta sqlrelay-xxx.tar.gz

	(where xxx is replaced with the version number)

	You can instruct the build process not to build certain modules by
	giving it one of the following flags:

		-without db2
		-without freetds
		-without firebird
		-without mysql
		-without odbc
		-without oracle
		-without postgresql
		-without sqlite
		-without sybase
		-without mdbtools
		-without perl
		-without python
		-without php
		-without ruby
		-without tcl
		-without java
		-without zope

	For example, if you want to build everything but the oracle and zope
	modules, then you would run the following command:

		rpm -ta -without oracle -without zope sqlrelay-xxx.tar.gz

	(where xxx is replaced with the version number)

	This will generate RPM's in the system-wide RPM directory (usually
	/usr/src/redhat/RPMS or /usr/local/rpm/RPMS) under the subdirectory
	corresponding to your system architecture.  You can install them by
	changing directories into that directory and executing the following
	command as root:

		rpm -i --nodeps sqlrelay-*
