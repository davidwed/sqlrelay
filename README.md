SQL Relay

    SQL Relay is a powerful database connection management solution.
    With SQL Relay, you can speed up and enhance the scalability of database-driven web-based applications, access databases from
    unsupported platforms, throttle database access, distribute load over clustered or replicated databases, route queries and 
    migrate applications from one database to another.

Advantages

    Persistent Database Connection Pooling - makes database-driven web-based applications faster and more efficient
    Proxying - provides access to databases from unsupported platforms
    Throttling - prevents databases from becoming overloaded
    High Availability - provides load balancing and failover with replicated or clustered databases
    Query Routing - conditionally sends queries to one database or another
    Query Filtering - prevents queries that match certain patterns from being run at all
    Connection Schedules - constrain database access to specified times

    Database Support - a wide variety of commercial and open-source databases are supported
    Abstraction Layer Support - drivers for most popular database abstraction layers are provided
    Drop-In Replacement Libraries - allow many native MySQL or PostgreSQL applications to use SQL Relay without modification
    Native API - the powerful native SQL Relay client API supports a wide variety of programming languages

    Substitution and Bind Variables - make frequently run queries faster and more efficient
    Multi-Row Fetches - reduce the number of network round-trips
    Client-Side Result Set Caching - makes paging faster and easier
    Suspended Transactions - allow a single transaction to span multiple web pages

    SQL Relay Enterprise Modules provide advanced features not available in the standard distribution.
    MySQL Front-End Modules - allow MySQL applications to use SQL Relay without modification and without a drop-in replacement library
    (more Enterprise Modules coming soon...)
