Release 1.0 RC 1 - June 3, 2008

 
Introduction 
------------
These files provide an Erlang version of the SQLRelay API. See http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

An Erlang module named test.erl demonstrates how to use the various functions.
This test program can be run once as shown below or can be tested multiple times using the method test:loop.  For example: test:loop(5) will run the tests 5 times..

Known bugs
-----------

1) mixedCaseColumnNames and lowerCaseColumnNames functions do not work correctlywith Oracle or ODBC database.  Columns are always returned in upper-case.

2) The function setResultBufferSize does not work correctly.  Calling this function has no effect on the number of results returned.

3) The prepareQuery and prepareQueryWithLength functions do not work correctly when tested with an Oracle or ODBC database.  However, the prepareFileQuery function does work correctly with Oracle or ODBC databases.

4) The getColumnIsPrimaryKeyByIndex does not work correctly when tested with an Oracle or ODBC database.

5) The getColumnIsPrimaryKeyByName does not work correctly when tested with an Oracle or ODBC database.

6) The following functions are not yet implemented:  subStrings, subLongs, subDoubles, inputBindStrings, inputBindLongs, inputbindDoubles.
