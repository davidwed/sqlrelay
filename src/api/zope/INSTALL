** Assumptions **

These directions assume that your Zope installation is in /usr/zope
and that your Python libraries are installed in /usr/lib/python1.5

If these assumptions do not apply to you then substitute your installation
paths for the ones in this document.



** Directions **

To install the Zope adapter, first copy or move the src/api/zope/ZSQLRelayDA
directory of this distribution into the /usr/zope/lib/python/Products directory.

Zope needs to know about the SQLClient python module as well. The most
portable way to make Zope aware of the module is to create a symbolic link 
from that directory to /usr/zope/lib/python/Products/ZSQLRelayDA/SQLRelay

The command:

ln -s /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/SQLRelay /usr/zope/lib/python/Products/ZSQLRelayDA/SQLRelay

should do the trick.

(the target of the link may need to be changed for your particular installation)

Now you're ready to use Zope and SQL Relay together.
