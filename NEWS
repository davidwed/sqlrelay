SQL Relay is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying, throttling, load balancing and query routing/filtering system for Unix and Linux supporting ODBC, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Firebird, SQLite and MS Access (minimally) with APIs for C, C++, .NET, Perl, Perl-DBI, Python, Python-DB, Zope, PHP, PHP PDO, PHP PDO, PHP PearDB, Ruby, Ruby-DBI, Java, TCL and Erlang, ODBC and ADO.NET drivers, drop-in replacement libraries for MySQL and PostgreSQL, command line clients and extensive documentation.  The APIs support advanced database operations such as substitution and bind variables, multi-row fetches, client-side result set caching and suspended transactions.  It is ideal for speeding up database-driven web-based applications, accessing databases from unsupported platforms, migrating between databases, distributing access to replicated or clustered databases and throttling database access.
