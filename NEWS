SQL Relay is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying and load 
balancing system for Unix and Linux supporting ODBC, Oracle, MySQL,
PostgreSQL, Sybase, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Firebird, SQLite and
MS Access (minimally) with APIs for C, C++, Perl, Perl-DBD, Python,
Python-DB, Zope, PHP, Ruby, Ruby-DBD, Java and TCL, drop-in replacement
libraries for MySQL and PostgreSQL clients, command line clients and extensive
documentation.  The APIs support advanced database operations such as bind
variables, multi-row fetches, client-side result set caching and suspended
transactions.  It is ideal for speeding up database-driven web-based
applications, accessing databases from unsupported platforms, migrating between
databases, distributing access to replicated databases and throttling database
access.
